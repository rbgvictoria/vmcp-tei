The longer I postpone to carry out this long cherished plan, the more difficult, I anticipate, will be its realisation. But as I can go only under certain favorable concessions from Government, it remains doubtful whether I shall be able to leave.</p>

I had furnished myself a handsome sketch of the desired extension; but the Office of public works regarded my plan too expensive and adopted an extremely plain one, which, I fully believe, will after all cost quite as much as that I suggested. Under any circumstances however the house will in future offer some airy cool rooms and a fine view over the Garden, and I have asked for the addition of a spacious balcony, whereby much to the convenience and appearance of the building will be added.</p>
