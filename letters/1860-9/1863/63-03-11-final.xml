Mr Wilson is now out of town and until he can fix a time to receive his portion it seems to be incurring a needless risk to remove them. With reference to the deer intended for New Zealand the Council are very reluctant to send these valuable creatures out of the country and it was decided to reconsider the matter at a future meeting when you should be present.<note xml:id="ftn3" type="footnote" n="3">

This being the first intimation of the fact that has reached the Council I am directed by them to enquire if you will kindly inform them whether the fish are still in existence and what probability there exists of our receiving some ova of this much coveted fish.'
