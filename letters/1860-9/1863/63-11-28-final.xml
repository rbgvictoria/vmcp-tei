When then my desire to give evidence was brought by myself under the notice of the honorable John O'Shanassy, that Gentleman referred me at once with perfect readiness to Dr Evans. But when on the 20 of October I attended at the Board, I was informed, that having closed their labours in bringing up their report, the Gentlemen constituting the Board could receive no further information and considered the Board not further in existence and regarded for any of its further actions it necessary that it should be reappointed by Government. Therefore no legitimate meeting of the Board could have been held after the 20 October without this reappointment.</p>

I think the alteration in the magnetic axis, which the specimen will suffer by its transmission to Europe, is therefore not now of sufficient justification to retain the specimen on this ground, especially as Sir Roderick Murchison, Professor Owen &amp; Professor Maskelyne are well aware of such alteration of magnetism, and have still advocated the transmission of the specimen to the British Museum.</p>
