I felt really very poorly &amp; though I was obliged to ride to town on official business in the afternoon of the day, I could accomplish it only with some difficulty. As I trust to be soon out in the field again, I may hope to see my strenght renovated.</p>

Pray let me know, whether there is anything I can send you, that you would like to take with you from here.</p>
