                     <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>In Despatch no. 14, 22 February 1864, Darling wrote that 'Dr Mueller is strongly under the impression that a relaxation of the strictness of the Rule has been permitted in more than one instance, and cites the case of Sir William Hooker as one in which the acceptance of the distinction of the Legion of Honor has been allowed by Her Majesty. The only books of reference on the subject at present within my reach, certainly describe Sir William Hooker as a Knight of the Legion of <space unit="chars" quantity="1"/>Honor: but are not definite as to that distinction having been assigned to him under Her Majesty's sanction. I perceive too, that the honor is said to have been granted in 1855: and it is possible therefore, that it was accepted before the restrictive regulations referred to, which bear date upon the 10th May in that year, came into force.' The Foreign Office note to the Colonial Office advising that the request must be refused also pointed out that 'Dr Müller is entirely mistaken in supposing that the Rules in question have been relaxed in favour of Sir William Hooker or any other person' (National Archives, London, CO 309/70, f. 98).</p>
