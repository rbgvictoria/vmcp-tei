Let me hope that you will simultaneously regain your cheerfulness &amp; not allow any sad feelings to disturb your tranquillity. You are right in anticipating that I feel much the absence of Sir Henry Barkly, for I had never a nobler friend and so powerful a supporter in my scientific engagements.<note xml:id="ftn3" type="footnote" n="3">

His marriage is off, and the subject not to be alluded to.' (H. Barkly to W. Hooker, 9 January 1864, RBG Kew, Directors' correspondence, vol. 60, f. 34).</p>
               </note> I had one audience with Sir Charles Darling and found him full of urbanity and certainly without any haughtiness, so that his Excellency must have been wrongly judged by people, and I have no doubt he will early remove any such impression.</p>
