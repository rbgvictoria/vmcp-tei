                     xml:lang="en">In April 1862 McKinlay for a time followed a 'magnificent stream' in the vicinity of 22° S, 142° E: 'it is at least 250 yards wide, and from forty to fifty feet down the banks to the water, lined with noble gums, box, bean, and other trees …'. This he named Mueller's Creek. (There had been good rains in the area, and much of the country to the southward was flooded at the time.) To the east, he named a 'well-defined range' Mount Mueller; see McKinlay (1862), pp. 72-3. 'Mueller's Range' is still shown on modern maps, but the 'magnificent stream' proved to be a stretch of the same river named Diamantina by William Landsborough in 1866 in honour of Lady Diamantina Bowen, wife of Sir George Bowen. Governor of Queensland; and Landsborough's name prevailed despite the priority of McKinlay's naming. See M to A. Petermann, 24 October 1876.</p>

I shall esteem it as one of the greatest honors I ever had bestowed on me, that my name has become thus connected with that enterprise of yours, for which you have earned the whole worlds admiration. I cannot do much to reciprocate your generous act, but it will be a source of gratification to me to attach to some noble new plant of the interior your name,<note xml:id="ftn3" type="footnote" n="3">
