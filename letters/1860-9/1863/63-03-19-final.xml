               </note> I am induced to take this step, as after my more than 15 years hard work in Australia, my health has become so fluctuating, as to render a longer seavoyage and more especially a certain repose from the turmoils of Office desirable. It is my intention to proceed to Europe and to stay for some time in Germany and to occupy myself in rendering myself acquainted by ocular observation with the progress of various branches of science, and to do this more effectually and to avoid unnecessary agitation I intend to observe a strict incognito, until I come over to England, from whence I contemplate to return by one of the Clippers to Melbourne. Thus in all probability I shall have the happiness of paying personally my respects to you, to Sir William &amp; Dr Hooker Prof Lindley &amp; other celebrities &amp; kind friends in Britain; but it is not likely that I shall be with you before the beginning of 1864. I do not think it would be advisable for me to engage during this limited time of my absense from home in any botanical investigations; therefore varied branches of medicine &amp; applied mathematics being probably the sciences to which I shall devote during my stay in Germany my attention. But after my return to Victoria I shall resume with new vigour &amp; undivided attention the labours of my special department</p>
