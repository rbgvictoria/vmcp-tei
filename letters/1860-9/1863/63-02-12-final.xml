One could supply all required. I am depending on the few thing I sell to get a living for my family, John Smith has £4.15 a week from Dr Mueller employed in the Gardens for himself and son and does not require to sell fruit to get his living though he has two places, a stand for Sunday on the Bridge and boys holding up fruit to every one passing. I was the first person got leave to sell near the Gardens, and now their are so many that my children and I are in deep want. I should not state this but your Worship wished me to do so, I shall leave it to your Worships judgment if this appears before the Council But Mr Fitzgibbon advised me not to interfear' (Unit 731, VPRS 3181, Public Record Office, Victoria).</p>
               </note> Allow me state, that the occupant Smith, is a most orderly old man with a respectable family and has been (and is still) employed for many years in this garden and that I was favorable to his occupying by your &amp; your colleagues permission the small plot of ground, as he can thereby exercise a better surveillance of the bridge built from the fund of my establishment (under a special vote) as otherwise could be the case &amp; protect the spalier &amp;c which the City Council was kind enough to add to it.</p>
