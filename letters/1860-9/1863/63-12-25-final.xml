               </note> to distinguish between my private feelings and my public duties, it will ever remain a source of the deepest regret, that the brilliant talents of Mr. Bentham were not rather occupied in the elucidation of the botanical treasures of Tropical Africa or some other region botanically unknown, and for the investigation of which the Kew collection would have afforded more ample material than that such a talent should be wasted in the edition of an Australian Flora; I venture to say, almost wasted, because in the course of time I could not have failed to carry out the most of the same detailed work now emanating from Bentham.</p>
