               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>I need not say, how profoundly sorry we all here are to loose our excellent Governor, though Sir Henrys ordinary tenure of Office has expired. As soon as we learnt, that his Excellency acced[e]s to the Governorship of Mauritius I pointed out, how valuable his patronage would be, if he would undertake the direction of the labours of botanical collector in Madagascar, where by the more peaceable inclinations of the present ruler under proper gubernatorial influence a botanical traveller might penetrate into the ranges of the interior. His Excellency with his usual urbanity &amp; readiness to promote scientific objects desired me to communicate at once with you, as we think one of your ordinary collectors might be disponible for the purpose of going to Madagascar. It would certainly the most cautious way to communicate first to his Excellency to Mauritius, who mean while would ascertain the whole of the facilities which he could offer for the collectors work. In the same degree as the traveller will penetrate into the interior ranges and towards the sources of the rivers, the harvest of endemic forms will become richer and richer.<note xml:id="ftn1" type="footnote" n="1">
