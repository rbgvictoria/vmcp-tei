The report was referred to a select committee of the Tasmanian Parliament who were considering a proposal for Tasmania to take direct responsibility for the introduction of the fish, rather than relying on a bonus for successful introduction. The select committee interviewed Black who made it clear that he was not content with the management arrangements proposed and would not answer to the General Association for the Australian Colonies, which had sponsored the experiment on <seg style="font-style: italic; ">S. Curling</seg>. The select committee reported <space unit="chars" quantity="1"/>to Parliament that a second attempt should be managed on its behalf in London by the General Association for the Australian Colonies, including the selection of the person to take charge of the transport. Black made his objections to the report public (A. Black (1860)) and it was responded to by the chairman of the select committee (Archer (1860)). For other accounts of the meetings of the select committee when they met Black, and the treatment of their report in Parliament, see <seg style="font-style: italic; ">Mercury</seg> (Hobart), 5 September 1860, pp. 2, 3; <seg style="font-style: italic; ">Mercury,</seg> 20 September 1860; and the <seg style="font-style: italic; ">Mercury</seg> editorial, 3 September 1860, p. 2.</p>

He prepared a report (A. Black (1861)), which attracted scathing criticsm (W. S. Macleay (1861)), to which A. Black (1861a) is a response.
