In 1858 and 1859, they did receive refreshments; but they were supplied by Dr. Mueller, expecting at the same time to be remunerated by the Government; but the Government objected, therefore the 40th had no refreshments last summer, but unfiltered water. And considering that the 40th had to play as a duty, and those musicians play there for pay, I think they have a deal of presumption to complain of not receiving refreshments. For the truth of my statement, you can refer to Mr. Johnson, bandmaster 40th Regiment' (<seg style="font-style: italic; ">Argus</seg>, 27 November 1860, p. 5).</p>
               </note> according to which I should have expected to be remunerated for the little hospitality shown to the excellent military band in 1857 and 1858? Such idea has never entered my mind, although I entertained a wish that, at the end of each season, a small collection might be made for presentation to the band, in acknowledgement of the great enjoyment which they caused to the multitude of visitors on the concert days to this garden.</p>

                     xml:lang="en">The response to ‘Justicia’ by the Bandmaster of the Volunteer Band, Henry Johnson, was published immediately after M’s letter: 'My band have requested me to state, in reply to the numerous letters which have appeared in your columns and in those of your contemporaries, and for the information of those gentlemen who take such a friendly interest in its welfare, that the suggestion, that the band be supplied with refreshments during their Saturday afternoon's performance in the gardens, did not emanate from them, nor do they know to whom to attribute it. They, however, wish it to be distinctly understood, that they do not require any refreshment at the expense of the public, or any private individual, but, should they require it, can pay for it themselves. The inference drawn from the voluminous correspondence, and from the frequent remarks in the public papers, is, that the band are "cadging" for as much as they can possibly get. By inserting this in your columns, you will disabuse the public mind of such an impression, and confer a great favour on the band.'
