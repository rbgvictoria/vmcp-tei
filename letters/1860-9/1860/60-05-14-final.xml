One ought not to judge without hearing all that can be said about Candidates.— But I was disgusted at the list; &amp; fancied I saw the effects of a great Surgeon-President.— Spence Bate &amp; Sir E. Tennent ought to have been elected long before R. Palmer &amp; Baring M.P.. It seems to me monstrous.’ Before the 1861 election Darwin added his signature to M's ‘Certifcate of a candidate for election’ (Royal Society, Archives, EC/1861/08).</p>
               </note> I have however had no voice whatever in the matter, nor been directly or indirectly consulted by any one regarding any candidate at all. I hope that you will be successful next year, &amp; all I can do is to repeat my promise that I will lose no opportunity of advancing your claim — I had done so already as strongly as I could, short of canvassing. I hope you will not be much disappointed. I shall keep your cheque against next year, or pay it over to Pamplin, whichever you please. Your chances of next year are naturally very much increased by the failure this — of which I shall not fail to make <seg style="">
