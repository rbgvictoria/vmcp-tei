                     xml:lang="en">On 3 December John Campbell, Secretary of the Caledonian Society of Victoria, wrote to the Chief Secretary, Richard Heales: 'I have the honor to inform you that the Directors of the Caledonian Society of Victoria have been priveleged last year and this year by permission from the Chief Secretary to hold their Annual Gathering on the Grounds of the Zoological Gardens. In 1859 the Stand was removed immediately after the Fetes and this year another has been erected of greater magnitude and security at a very heavy expense. The Society is instituted for benevolent purposes, as well as the promotion of healthful out of door sports. The Directors last year voted Seventy Pounds to aid the funds of the Charitable Institutions of Melbourne besides assisting in many Cases of individual distress. The erection of a new Stand each year, being a serious drawback to the prosperity of the Institution, the Directors have ventured to memorialize you upon the subject, and to request that the Stand be allowed to remain. The Directors in making this application have sought for information from the Committee of the Zoological Gardens and are glad to find that no inconvenience will arise from the Stand being left permanently, and it will be a saving for the Benevolent Fund of upwards of Eight Hundred Pounds per Annum.' <space unit="chars" quantity="1"/>The Under Secretary, J. Moore, asked M on 11 December 'to report whether there is any objection on the part of the Zoological Garden Committee' (Q60/11050, unit 748, VPRS 1189, Public Record Office, Victoria).</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>I beg leave to draw your attention also to the circumstance, that the building erected by the Caledonian Society in the zoological Reserve is of the crudest &amp; most inelegant structure, not built to last for any longer period than the games of this year. I may be further permitted to bring under your consideration, that the permanent occupation of any part of the Governments ground under my charge by property of a private society would introduce a new element of administration or supervision into this establishment, so as to render my functions &amp; that of the zoological Committee greatly impaired.</p>

               </note> &amp; no application for its permanently remaining has been made to the Gentlemen of the zoological Committee &amp; as it even is doubtful, whether the Committee can renew the sanction of holding the games on the ground, (our deer having been lost on the last occasion,) — I have ventured to reply, in order that no delay may arise to the arrangements of removal of the building.</p>
