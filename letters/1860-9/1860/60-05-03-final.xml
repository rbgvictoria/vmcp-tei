               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>Availing ourelfes of the early autumnal rains, we transferred several thousand rare plants from the nurseries to the flower borders, made extensive sowings of summerplants and commenced renewing the edgings of the flower borders, which were either worn out or parched by the excessive heat of the last summer. Advantage was also taken of the early rains in laying many parts of the reserve out in rye grass and clover, the same means being adopted for restoring in due time the much-trodden lawns to their verdure. Rows of trees are planted along two of the main walkes of the Northern Grounds, spreading poplars &amp; Blue Gum-trees being chosen for the purpose, and these are secured by handsome tree guards against the animals pasturing in that part of the Garden.</p>

The same fate was shared by the Gold-fishes, transmitted by Mr Edward Wilson; also a great loss was experienced during the voyage and shortly after their arrival amongst the singing birds, procured by the same zealous Gentleman and shipped per "Maidstone". The birds having had for the greater part not well constructed cages and not sufficient cleanliness, arrived here partially almost featherless and infested with insects, thus the survivors being not even able to endure the weather of this season at our aviary, for which reason they will be kept in our palm-house til they have obtained their plumage again.</p>

It is contemplated to give an unimpeded access to the Yarra foot bridge also at night time, by removing the middle iron Gate to the entrance of the bridge and by fencing off a small lateral path leading to the adjoining public road. The iron Aviary bridge has been raised and gravelled. The Hon. the board of lands &amp; works have been pleased to add to the Northern part of the Garden the triangular piece of ground, stretching between the new continuation of Swan Street and our area, comprising about 4 acres which will be fenced as soon as the means will be available.</p>
