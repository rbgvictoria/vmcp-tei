               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>There are a few principle arrangements, on which to some extent the success of the Victorian Expedition may depend &amp; which I would like to point out to you before you take your departure.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>Let me advise you, to divide the care of the animals strictly amongst the party. Let each of them be responsible for the packing of a certain number of the animals, of their unloading, attending to them for cleaning, watering, hobbling &amp;c You will excite by this arrangement not only emulation amongst your subordinates as regards the speed of packing, but also in having kept the animals, their saddles, bags &amp;c in as good an order as possible. From the alloted duties to certain animals not even your officers should be exempted.</p>

               </note> that part of the night watch should be allotted, most favorable for observation. Let the watch be divided into four periods from 8-10, 10-12, 12-2, 2-4. Whoever is on duty from 8-10 one day, should be on duty from 10-12 the next &amp; so on in rotation. I cannot sufficiently impress on you the necessity, that breakfast should be served at 4 o'clock. It will enable your party to look for the horses &amp;c before 5 in the morning, when every one will be least fatigued by a walk (in the heat which you will soon experience going northward), in search of the hobbled animals and when their loading will be less onerous than later in the day. It will moreover enable you to have completed a fair days distance in good time for preparing the nights camp and for constructing the chart of the days march. You will by this arrangement also intercept the animals in their rambling, which chiefly takes place at daybreak.</p>
