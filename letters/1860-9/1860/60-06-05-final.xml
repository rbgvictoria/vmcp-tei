The nursery furnished during this month many thousand plants to public institutions throughout the colony, and from our seed magazine were likewise extensive contributions obtained. The nursery ground is doubly enlarged and for the greater part now restocked with seeds and cuttings, to meet the increasing demands next years.</p>

An Elm avenue has been formed along the S.E. verge of our reserve. Attention has likewise been given to the plantations in the domain between Princes Bridge and the botanic Garden. The new iron-fences have been nearly completed as far as the fund available in this establishment rendered the extension possible, and since the honorable the board of lands &amp; works have kindly sanctioned the erection of additional 44 rods, we will be able to include two acres of the reserve at the S. West part of the garden for the purpose of establishing a continuous curve of iron fences around the main gardens, thereby adding to the extent of the class-ground. The Commencement is made for laying out the ground around the office into an orchard, with a view of having a plant of any approved kind of vine or fruit trees in our collection. The landscape-beauty of the spot however will remain unimpaired, as the fruit-plants will only be interspersed between native and planted evergreen trees and shrubs.</p>
