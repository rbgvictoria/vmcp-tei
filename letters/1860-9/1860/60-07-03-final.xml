Some surprise has been occasionally manifested as to my not adopting Oakes, Limes and Horse chesnuts for the same purpose. The trees however, scattered throughout our ground of these particular kinds, may prove at once to any careful observer, that nothing could surpass the trist appearance of the Oak, (with dead leaves adhering to it during the most verdant season of the year) and of the Lime and Horse chessnut the foliage of which is here burned up at the first hot wind in the summer. These particular trees, altho' well adopted for being intermixed with those, which nature created in the zone of evergreen vegetation both in the northern and southern hemisphere, could not be judiciously or tastfully placed along our lawn walks, altho' they may be used advantageously for lining some of our public streets. Many kinds again prospering in any moist river vallies, are found to be inadopted for so exposed a locality as this garden.</p>
