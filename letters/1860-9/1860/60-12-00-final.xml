               </note> you were congratulated upon the successful accomplishment of the laborious undertaking to raise the sum of £2000 by private subscription, in order to secure the munificent donation of £1000, promised by an anonymous donor, on that condition, for the purpose of organising a party to explore the interior of Australia.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>The importance of taking advantage of the winter season to penetrate the arid regions of the interior was not overlooked by your Committee, but as a sum of £3000 had been forwarded by Government to India, to purchase camels for this express object, it was deemed, after careful consideration, to be better to await the arrival of these "ships of the desert," rather than hasten the departure of the Expedition before they arrived. A light party, to reconnoitre the vicinity of Cooper's Creek, was at one time seriously thought of, but no advantage seemed likely to be gained by such a proceeding, that would compensate for the large additional outlay it would entail.</p>

The names of several highly eligible gentlemen were submitted for consideration, but, after mature deliberation, it was resolved to announce that the appointment was open, and candidates were invited to offer their services.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>In reply to this invitation a number of gentlemen, of various qualifications, presented their credentials, and sought the arduous but honorable post. The difficulty your Committee experienced in making a selection was increased by the number of apparently suitable candidates that offered their services. After much anxious inquiry and careful deliberation, your Committee selected Robert O'Hara Burke, Esq., Superintendent of Police in the Castlemaine district, and formerly a cavalry officer in the Austrian service, whose appointment to this onerous office was duly endorsed by the Government.</p>

Accordingly the whole number of applicants were invited to meet the leader at the Hall of the Royal Society, when out of about 700 candidates the following were selected, after personal interviews and careful inquiries: —</p>

Across the country by the most direct route to Cooper's Creek, in lat. 27° 37' 8", long. 141° 5', where the party would be on the verge of the unexplored country, and on a spot where permanent water could be had, and a depot formed, whence excursions could be made to the north or north-west as might be deemed desirable, and upon which the party could at any time fall back for supplies in case of necessity.</p>
