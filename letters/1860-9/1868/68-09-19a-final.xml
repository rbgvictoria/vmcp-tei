The new seedharvest will commence about November and be to some extent completed in April, when larger collections could be prepared of such fresh seeds, while smaller lots of the seeds of the former harvest could meanwhile be provided. The Agent General moreover would be in an extremely favorable position to effect for some of these seed collections a return of seeds of other countries, by which means the botanic Garden and in many instances the colony at large might be enriched.</p>
