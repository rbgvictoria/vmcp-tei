Jimmy said it occurred when he was a little boy, and I should take him to be now from 30 to 35 years old. He said he knew well one of the principal men concerned, a native named "Bowering," who died only a few months since. It took place at a spot he had seen, at a spring near the bank of a very large lake, so large he said that it looked like the sea as seen from Rottnest, eleven days' journey from "Ninghan" in a fine country; the white men were rushed upon while making a damper, and clubbed and speared; he had often seen one of the axes that formed a portion of the plunder.' <space unit="chars" quantity="1"/>
