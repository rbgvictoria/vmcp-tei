               </note> and that I have provided and caused to be selected by an experienced Gardener of this establishment the necessary number of rooted plants and strong cuttings both of Basket- and Weeping Willow, 700 of which are planted already. On close calculation it is found now, that it will take at least 3000 plants in all to complete the planting on the townside of the river up to the punt-road, and I now respectfully request that the Council will kindly grant the labor of the two men, now working, for a few weeks longer, in order that this highly important and useful work may be well accomplished at once.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>2, The double fencing on the Yarra affords considerable facility, to plant the space between the river and the nearest fence-line, and I cannot help to point out the very great desirability of raising some vegetation on the intermediate space. I venture thus to suggest for the favorable consideration of the City Council, that a plough may a few times traverse the line. I would then undertake to scatter some wattle and Gum-tree seeds and grains of other quick growing plants along the ploughed line, by which measure a line of evergreen vegetation would be established, so desirable when in the cool season the willows are defoliated</p>
