               </note> dear Mr Barlee, and am glad to learn, that you are so interested in the plants and seeds, which I send you. These transmissions, I need not say, will be continued, season after season. I am longing to revisit W.A., but am uncertain, whether my wish can be realized. My private property is sunk in the department, and the latter is so extensive and requires such multifarious attention, that it is really difficult to get away for a period sufficiently long for any extensive investigations.</p>
            <p rend="letter"

               xml:lang="en">
               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>To some extent however I would be influenced in my decision, if I knew whether any facilities for my travels could be afforded by the local means at the disposal of Governments Departments. If so it might induce me to prolong my stay and to bring with me one or two attendents. It occurs to me that probably you might have it in your power to provide for the loan of some Governments Horses and some travelling equipment; the whole of the latter I could not very well bring from here. I am eager to examine your eastern interior and might be induced to push considerably beyond the settlements. My principle object would be to contrast the vegetation inland with that of south Australia. But incidentally I might shed light on other subjects, altho I would not undertake special duties in this regard. I would like to pass the later summer months in your territory, when I could combine gathering seed for this garden with my other objects. But as I have as yet not communicated with the Minister, under whom the Department is placed, on the intended W.A. journey, I must ask you to consider this communication for the present confidential; indeed it is not my intention to refer the subject to the consideration of the Victorian Government until the end of the year, if then I see my way clear to ber the heavy outlay to be incurred, an outlay which must be very great even if I had horses and equipment supplied by your Government on loan. Pray, do not misunderstand me; it is not my wish to cause any <seg style="">
                  <hi rend="underline">direct</hi>
               </seg> monetary outlay to your Government; but you might perhaps afford collateral aid without any expenses.</p>
