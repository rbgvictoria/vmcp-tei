In this instance I venture to suggest, that the descent to the boathouses should commence a few yards further on along the bridge, or that the yard or two of space, where any one at night time may tumble down, may be secured by some railing.</p>

At a meeting on 23 June it was reported that: 'The estimated cost of erecting steps on the south side of Princes Bridge at the east approach leading to the Boat-Houses is £20. Chairman instructed to report to Council recommending that authority be given for the erection of the steps the cost to be borne out of the Toll Fund.'
