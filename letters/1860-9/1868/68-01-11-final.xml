                     xml:lang="en">No letter from M to FitzGibbon dated 11 December 1867 has been found, but M had raised the same issues in M to E. FitzGibbon, 30 November 1867. M to J. Butters, 28 November 1867, mentions the tree guards in the context of the nuisance caused by grazing cattle. The issues had exercised M for some time. He complained about the grazing cattle as early as M to E. FitzGibbon, 7 January 1867, with the cottage brought into the discussion in M to A. K. Smith, 2 April 1867;  an undated memorandum to the Melbourne City Council Health Committee, written after May 1867 ( in this edition as 67-00-00) refers to both these points in the context of the planned visit of Prince Albert, Duke of Edinburgh, which took place at the end of November 1867. It is not clear which of these letters, or others not found, were placed before the Health Committee at its meeting on 8 January 1868: 'Letter read from Doctor Mueller relative to the unsightly appearance of the patched Verandah to the House on the Bank of the River in Yarra Park. Town Clerk instructed to Reply that money has been voted for the repair of the Verandah by the City Council and that the work shall be done. Letter from Doctor Mueller offering to supply tree guards and plants for Yarra Park if the Committee would find the labor of planting the trees. The Park Ranger directed the attention of the Committee to the fact that the trees planted by Doctor Mueller in the Yarra Park some years ago are still stunted and small in consequence of the defective manner in which the work has been done. Town Clerk instructed to inform Doctor Mueller that the Committee would prefer doing the work themselves if he would hand them over the tree Guards.'
