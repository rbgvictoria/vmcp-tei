I regret to say that I go on very slowly with them having many interuptions, one month passes after another &amp; little progress is made, but the collecting &amp; drying the specimens takes much time — The names I give to the plants must in most cases be altogether wrong, &amp; besides not having looked at Botany for a long period I have forgotten a great deal of what I then knew. I therefore feel much obliged by having the correct names &amp; which I register in my collection. The first mentioned are the <name key="Acacia">Acacia</name>e I have a few more species to send [2d] <name key="Baeckia%20diffusa">Baeckia diffusa</name>
