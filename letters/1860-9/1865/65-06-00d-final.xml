To Mr M'Intyre the command has been entrusted, and ample latitude has been allowed him for the choice of his officers and men and their requirements.

               <seg style=""> A methodical search and a constant interrogation of the nomadic tribes will, it is hoped, secure full success for the primary object of the enterprise, and for this purpose two or three natives will be permanently attached to the party, and temporarily others as occasions may occur. The party will consist of not less than eight individuals throughout, and this number may possibly still be increased should contributions from private sources flow in so largely within the next week as to warrant augmenting the party, and its equipments and animals.</seg>
