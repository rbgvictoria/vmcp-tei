It is not material to the end in view to explain by what accidents I have been hindered in making an earlier acknowledgement. You will, however, I doubt not understand, that this delay has arisen from no want of regard to yourself, or want of respect to the committee of ladies, and certainly from no coolness in my feelings towards the object which I long ago advocated, although in vain.</p>

               </note> The letters in which I discussed this question were published in the <seg style="font-style: italic; ">Sydney Morning Herald</seg>, and they elicited various comments. At that time nothing was known of the geography of the districts which I supposed Leichardt must have traversed, and I was anxious that that part of the country should be explored. Since then, different expeditions have been undertaken, and through them the character of the region has been made known.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>It is very satisfactory to me that I did not mistake the question, and that in that very region traces of Leichardt have been found. I did not, however, content myself with this discussion. I appealed, on 16th September, 1858, to the Government of New South Wales, requesting that further steps be taken to clear up the mystery attached to the fate of Leichardt, and to explore the country between 25° and 18° south latitude and between 144° and 148° east longitude.°</p>

If we may believe the statements that have been made, Leichardt has been traced to within 600 miles of the north-west coast, where, I still think, as I have always thought, he long ago arrived. I cannot say I think he is still living. But it is a question involving so many subjects of interest that the discovery of the spot which he finally reached is scarcely inferior to the discovery of his actual fate.

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>Believing that Stuart, who had many and serious conflicts with the aborigines, and found them extremely hostile and violent, actually obtained evidence of Leichardt's progress, in spite of such harassing difficulties, to within 430 miles of A. C. Gregory's most southern point, it is clear to me our great traveller had materially reduced the obstacles before him. But I conceive that it was not till he had got so far that his greatest trials began.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>We know now that the continent up to Stuart's route is not all desert. Nevertheless, there are 500 miles of country between A. C. Gregory's farthest southern point in your expedition of 1855-6 and F. T. Gregory's most northern point in his expedition of 1861. Those 500 miles appear to me almost insurmountable; and had Leichardt crossed them, and had come within what may now be called the settled portion of the northern part of West Australia—say about Nichol Bay—he would still have had to encounter enormous hardships and dangers, ill-furnished as he was with supplies.</p>
