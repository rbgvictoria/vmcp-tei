               </note> I feel that my ideas on this subject are in disharmony with those of the vast majority of living nature's philosophers; and yet I feel a calm consciousness of their truth. I contemplate as type of the meaning species man himself. A species to me is a organism, requiring special creation, never to be confounded with anything else, though often misunderstood by not due allowances being made for its power of variation, a power different in different species and often largely greater than in man or even domestic animals. To characterize a species we have to look for such distinctive marks, resting on absolute difference of internal structure as never <seg style="">
                  <hi rend="underline">can</hi>
               </seg> be over turned. On every other diagnosis, based on [moving] characters I look at once with suspicion. We see nowhere transits between real generic forms, and if we have the specific forms in each genus not rightly circumscribed and understood, it arises out of the circumstance of our not having our observations sufficiently extended over the globe. Genera nevertheless are to me nothing but an artificial complex of species of certain resemblance. Man stands by himself; he is not connected by any middleform whatsoever with other beings; and so indeed it is with every true species. Circumstances may give races may give varieties a <seg style="">
                  <hi rend="underline">local</hi>
               </seg> permanence, but this will not be a lasting one <seg style="">
                  <hi rend="underline">elsewhere </hi>
               </seg>and will entitle never such a variety or race to specific distinction. I exhibited to you a series of Epilobia, pointing out that in N.Z. the only <name key="Epilobium">Epilobium</name> of the Southern hemisphere assumes a form, not yet met with elsewhere; but this race is even there not upheld by permanent tangible characters and hence every attempt, as Dr Hookers new handbook<note xml:id="ftn5" type="footnote" n="5">

When I first travelled in the colony of Victoria I never saw a single plant of <name key="Portulaca%20oleracea">Portulaca oleracea</name> any where, a plant that is not readily overlooked; during the latter years, probably from the accidental dispersion of some seeds it has spread so extensively as to have become a plague in much garden land and to be quite frequent in the streets of Melbourne. Had this spreading taken place at the early time of the settlement of Victoria, I should have entertained as little doubt about the Portulaca being indigenous here, as I felt when seeing it on every street gutter and around every house in Rio de Janeiro.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>You will ask what is to be done in arranging and naming plants, about the specific value of which from imperfect evidence we remain doubtful.

Were this rule obeyed, we would free the descriptive history of plants &amp; animals of an oppressive incubus.
