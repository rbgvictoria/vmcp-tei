               </note> my grateful acknowledgments for their sympathy with our movement, which I trust will not be regarded as one of Victoria alone, but as a national one of all Australia. All in our power shall be done to guard the enterprise against distrust and failure: and thus I hope the confidence placed in us here will not prove misapplied. Mr. Donald Campbell, of Glengower, near Castlemaine, the uncle of Mr. M'Intyre, is expected to be in Melbourne this week, when probably final arrangements will be entered into for the expedition; and as his nephew is collecting horses, &amp;c., on the Darling River, we can anticipate his starting in fair time for this season. You will see that the South Australians are also bestirring themselves vigorously in aiding the good work, and the Victorian Government will also contribute to the search fund, though the amount to be offered is not yet fixed. This measure of our Government will, as far as I can learn, meet with universal approval in Parliament, nearly thirty members to whom I have spoken having, with great readiness, pledged themselves to vote for the proposition. It is of the highest importance that the subsidies promised by the three Governments should, in reality, be secured by Parliamentary vote <seg style="">
                  <hi rend="underline">as soon as possible</hi>
               </seg>, for the legal documents cannot be drawn up before, and no binding engagements can be made in anticipation of these grants. We now have nearly one thousand pounds collected by private subscriptions. I am happy to say that Sir William Denison and Sir Henry Barkly have already spoken in laudatory terms of this intended expedition, and I am very glad to find that your Colonial Secretary (Mr. Herbert) has kindly extended to the Ladies' Committee his consideration and aid in this movement. Please convey my kind regards to Mr. Gordon Sandeman and Mr. Dalrymple; also to Mr. A. C. Gregory, whose influence and good heartedness are fully appreciated. This month’s mail, and more particularly the next, will show how this expedition is received in Europe.<note xml:id="ftn4" type="footnote" n="4">
