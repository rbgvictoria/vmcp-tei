Perhaps before this reaches you arrangements will have been made to despatch a party at once, to solve the problem of Leichhardt's fate; and doubtless, under your auspices, sufficient contributions from private sources will be easily obtained to enable a party to equip themselves in a proper manner for the due performance of such a task. In any case, the fault of failure will not be yours, for all who read your lecture must feel surprised that the undertaking was not accomplished years ago.</p>

For years I have husbanded the idea, and had I had the opportunity I would either have shared his fate, let it be whatever it may, or solved the mystery. You, at least, will not be surprised at my feelings on this matter, and you will easily comprehend how ardently I desire to see some attempt made that will result in setting at rest once and for ever the doom of my honoured and revered friend — for be he dead, I hold it as a stigma upon us that we do not know that he is so; and leaving poor L. entirely out of the question, surely all will admit that each individual of the party is entitled to every exertion we can use to rescue them, if living, from the miserable existence they must be enduring.</p>
