                     <seg style="">The Royal Society, of which they are both members, with its Exploration Committee, of which they were both also members, achieved anything but success and glory in its connection with the Burke and Wills Expedition. Dr. Mueller has been out a little on the northern coast with one of the Gregorys, and ought to know something about exploration. He never, however, led a party, or had to provide for the general outfit of an exploring expedition. A man immersed in books as he has been for years cannot be supposed to understand the practical working of such an undertaking; and as for Dr. Wilkie, he knows nothing whatever about such things, except by hearsay.... The Burke tragedy is too fresh in the public recollection to entrust another expedition to the Royal Society. What is required is an advising committee of experienced bushmen....</seg>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>I can assure our assailant that Dr Wilkie's actions throughout the harassing former expedition affair can stand the test of the closest criticism, and that in any future consultations I shall ever attach great value to his ideas and his judgment. Being once called into the arena, I may likewise now repel the attacks of the Murray squatter against myself. I leave it to others to judge whether, after traversing Australia since 1848, in lines of about 24,000 miles, and these to a vast extent as an independent traveller, and after having practically served in the field for the promotion of natural science, even for a series of years before in Germany and Scandinavia, and after I have never lent myself to deviations from public duties for personal considerations or otherwise, he is justified in his notions.</p>

Or does the Kasima gentleman really think that a man like Mr M'Intyre, or one of his stamp, would require any advice for this search, or any rules offered for his equipment? Or is the "Murray Squatter" intending to impede the search by fixing a route, while the movements of a search party must absolutely depend on the incidents of each day?</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>Of the scope of the enterprise, which so well has been entrusted to the ladies' care, and is so well sustained by their active and intelligent solicitude, sufficient has been enunciated before an unrestrictedly invited public at St. George's Hall as to enable any one to comprehend its basis. Months ago it was there stated, that when the fund was obtained, the ladies would for any advice needed for the practical initiation of their enterprise consult with gentlemen, and the fair promoters of this high cause are not likely to choose advisers who do not carry public confidence with them.</p>

But after all that has been done, it is sad to contemplate, that while every thoughtful, well-meaning and disinterested man should give his support to this national act of duty, we should still find those, who spread diffidence and withhold aid. The Murray Squatter will, I trust, reflect, that while he discourages the ladies in their noble task he incurs a responsibility, and creates delay, and perhaps injury, for which a resentful Nemesis on his own path of life may yet retaliate, and while uninformed obtruding his advice and passing his opinion, he may extinguish in many into whose hands his letter may fall, that spark of sympathy, and that glimmering of hope, which the ladies appeal for the abandoned explorer endeavours to kindle among the just, highminded and charitable.</p>
