               </note> I took every opportunity of questioning the natives as to parties of white men in the interior, and this I did so far as lat. 25deg. 30min. south. Speaking the language of that part of the interior, I could be sure of understanding and making myself understood. I found that the natives were acquainted with Sturt's party—they pointed out to me the line of his march, and said that he had a cart with him; also that of Gregory, and showed me the tracks of his horses in one place; and of course knew all about the later explorers. But I could never gain the least intelligence of such a party as Leichhardt's, and I feel confident that their traces must be sought for considerably north of the latitude I have named, as information, as you well know, is carried to a considerable distance among the tribes.</p>
