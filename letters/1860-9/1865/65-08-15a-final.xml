               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/> The foundation of a chair for technological and agricultural chemistry would be a true blessing for your land. It is of the highest importance to acquaint the agricultural population with the principles by which they may be placed in a position to maintain the fertility of their fields; and for this we should not wait until the decrease of productiveness is recognised. It is infinitely easier, and involves less cost, to maintain a fertile field unimpaired in its high produce than to restitute fertility when once decreased. Only by imparting to the cultivators scientific doctrines is it possible to bring them to a recognition of what ought to be their action. Some time ago, I had a visit from two gentlemen from Ohio, who were sent by the States to Europe, to become acquainted with our agricultural institutions. I was told that since the first settlement, in the year 1804, the productiveness of their fields through the spoliation system customary there had decreased in the most striking manner; so much so that the state of things had engaged the most serious attention of the Government. Accordingly, the means for the formation of an agricultural institute were readily provided. Some years large grain exports had been sent from Ohio, explaining the rapid exhaustion of the land. I am, as you perhaps know, a decided opponent of the so-called agricultural academies away in the country. By their isolated position, remote from the centre of scientific activity, they are constantly in danger to degenerate instead of keeping pace with the progress of science, they remain behind; and thus have the rural academies in Germany shown themselves all along as the personal antagonists of the teachings of natural science. At the University of Halle a commencement was made three years ago to establish a chair for agricultural discipline; and Professor Kueter, who commenced with three, students, has now already 120. This great success has verified my predictions. In Bonn and Gottingen likewise, chairs for husbandry are now created. To connect a large estate with these chairs I regard as certainly injurious. A few experimental fields are sufficient. In a school the principles only require to be taught. The practice must be learnt on a rural estate. Particularly useful with us are the so-called experimental stations for husbandry, at the head of which an agricultural chemist is placed. They are maintained by voluntary contributions from the agricultural associations. The chief of such a station is the special adviser of the farmers, who informs them of the nature of the soils, of the manure appropriate for the maintenance and augmentation of their harvests. He carries on the analysis of the manures, and he delivers lectures at various places on the principles which the practical man should certainly keep before his eyes, and thus connects the science with the practice. The achievements of these experimental stations, in regard to the nutrition of animals, are extraordinary, as far as the production of meat and milk are concerned. We contend that in Germany the meat is produced half as cheap as in countries where these simple laws of nutrition are riot generally known.</p>
