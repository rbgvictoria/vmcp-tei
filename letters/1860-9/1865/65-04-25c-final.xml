               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>I have ventured, honored and dear Sir, on behalf of the Delegates of the Victorian Ladies to a committee for fostering Leichhardt's search, to transmit to you their letter of appeal, thinking that you might in your official &amp; private positions be enabled to foster properly their noble objects. In an enterprise, which is likely to extend the geographical knowledge of your territory your Government would be directly interested and as a movement of humanity it claims the sympathy of all high minded people. The Ladies have by this mail adressed appeals to her Majesty, to the Princess of Wales and to the Princess of Prussia and to many leading Ladies and Gentlemen throughout the world. So they trust by united action their expedition will not suffer to be accomplished for mere want of support.</p>

This man gave us to understand that a long time ago his friend Boodgin, who is also a rambler, related to him that three white men, with horses, had come to some large body of salt water a long way to the eastward, and after travelling some time along the shore, they turned back again, when they were either killed by the Jimbars, which they describe, or perished from want of water. He believes their bones still remain there.'</p>
