                     xml:lang="en">The Leichhardt Search Expedition crossed the Murray on Friday and is now, we are informed, en route to Mount Murchison. It is high time that Dr. Mueller, who seems to have taken the entire management of the affair, should vouchsafe some information to the subscribers and to the general public. Of course the learned doctor is too anxious to obtain kudos from his fellow-countrymen in Europe to care anything for the interests of Victoria, whose only claim upon him is that she pays him a handsome salary, and allows him to make use of her resources in order to extend his scientific fame; but the Ladies’ Committee should take a different view of their responsibilities. The public and the Government have a right to know what agreement has been entered into by the committee with Mr. M’Intyre, Dr. Murray, and the subordinate members of the party; what instructions have been given to them as to the localities they are to search; and the amount of money likely to be required. Victoria has no direct interest in these hazardous ventures, and it will be too bad if, in our desire to solve the mystery in which the fate of the great explorer is involved, the colony should only expose itself to the risk of losing men and money in a fruitless expedition.</p>
               </note> Allow me, then, on behalf of the lady delegates, to inform you that the preliminary arrangements have met with the full concurrence of Dr Wilkie and Mr Ellery, who in a zealous and disinterested manner have shown their wish to promote and facilitate the enterprise; and further that when the kindly-promised subsidies from the other colonies will have been assured, these arrangements for the expedition will receive their final confirmation, or perhaps slight alterations, according to the support experienced, and then what can be of general interest to the public will be rendered known. Meanwhile the party proceeds to its rendezvous at Mount Murchison.<note xml:id="ftn3" type="footnote" n="3">

I doubt whether any man of ability and experience, any man deserving of confidence, would engage in the task on other terms. As to the localities to be searched, I may state that the party intends to proceed to the farthest northern position attained by Leichhardt. Should the forlorn traveller have carried out his plan to penetrate from thence towards the S. W. part of this continent, the interrogations will be extended generally in that direction, as far as the physical features of the country admit, which will often demand deviations. Should, however, Leichhardt's party, after calamities have passed on southward in a retrograde movement from the Gulf of Carpentaria to the settlements, then his vestiges will be followed to Bunderabulla<note xml:id="ftn5" type="footnote" n="5">

               </note> or wherever they lead to. You will agree, Mr Editor, that it would be the height of imprudence to lay down a route of operations whereby probably the object we all have so much at heart would be frustrated. The third question asked I regard extremely odd. Whom concerns it, except the legally contracting parties, what precise sum will be required for the enterprise? Yet over and over it has been publicly stated that Mr M'Intyre had offered to conduct the search during two years for £3000, an offer which reflected the more credit in the gentleman, and which we may regard the more a guarantee for his high-mindedness, as it provided most inadequately personal reward. But fulfilling his mission the ladies are not likely to fail recognising his services in a substantial manner; but after two years' exertions the party may not have followed Leichhardt further than to the centre of the Continent, though during its movement much more country will be mapped than along ordinary exploring lines, and it may need a second mission and a second outlay to resume the search from the last camps obtained. I entirely dissent from the idea enunciated in your columns that Victoria has no direct interest in these explorative enterprises, for whatever tends to advance the geographical knowledge of Australia will unavoidably promote settlement, and therewith the common trade and industry of our own community. The passage in <seg style="font-style: italic; ">The Herald</seg> evinces so much unjust and unprovoked hostility that I cannot, sir, for a moment regard its remarks as the exponent of your own enlightened and equitable views, but see in them the personal ill-feeling of one or the other of the few whose active discouragement and reprehensible opposition have been encountered. Onslaughts of this kind are calculated to produce a disheartening effect not only momentary, but on the furtherance of future objects of a kindred tendency, and they are in this instance the more painful as they must wound the tender feelings of the fair who mustered courage to uphold Leichhardt's cause, and whose circumspect and clever actions on the poor traveller's behalf entitle them to the grateful respect, and the admiration of every one whose feelings are not closed to humanity and who can elevate himself to national pride.— </p>
