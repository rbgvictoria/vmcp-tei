               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>I have the honor to submit to your favorable consideration the desirability of the portion of land near the city bridge and now occupied as pastureground of the Immigrants home being rendered available for planting operation during the forthcoming season, the locality referred to being not only so accessible from the city and therefore so eligible for tree plantation, but also comprising the best soil in the whole reserve. It seems to me moreover highly desirable that no time should be lost in raising trees on the spot for the ornamentation of the city landscape and in anticipation of the ground being required as part of Government-House domain.</p>

                     xml:lang="en">The Under Secretary, J. Moore, forwarded this letter to the Superintendent of the Immigrants Aid Society, J. Harcourt, on 18 January for his comments. Harcourt replied on 23 January: 'It is of the utmost importance that good fresh Milk should be obtained for the use of the many infant children in this Institution their very existence depends on such a supply. Contract Milk is never satisfactory, it was on that account that permission to graze the cows was sought and obtained. With regard to the <seg style="">

                        <hi rend="underline">milk</hi>
                     </seg> from Sunbury, that cannot be effected at present, I hope in time to obtain a supply from the farm intended to be established there, but before that can be done the ground has to be fenced, as the pasture is now consumed by the town herd &amp;c, Milking sheds will have to be erected, and other arrangements made. If it is the opinion of the Hon the Chief Secretary that the Cows should be removed from the reserve, it will be necessary to erect Cow houses, and feed the cows on purchased provender.' On 30 January McCulloch minuted: 'The land is not immediately required and in the [course] of 3 or 4 months — there will be a sufficient number of Cows at Sunbury to maintain better [Establishments] — until then I cannot grant the permission asked'. Moore duly passed on this minute to M who replied on 31 January: 'Returned with thanks for the information conveyed'.</p>
