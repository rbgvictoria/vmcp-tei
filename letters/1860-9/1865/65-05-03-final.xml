               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>It is my pleasing task to offer on behalf of the ladies who are so nobly engaged in effecting arrangements for a renewed search of Dr. Leichhardt and his companions, a brief record of their proceedings. Through your generous mediation more than a thousand squatters have been addressed. Special letters of appeal have also been sent not merely to many of our fellow colonists, but likewise to numerous personages of Europe, pre-eminent in charity or social position. Sub-committees for aiding the ladies' enterprise have been formed, or are under the process of formation in several parts of the sister colonies. The Medical Society — to show its respect to the lost explorer as a member of its profession, and as one who by the generosity of an English physician,<note xml:id="ftn2" type="footnote" n="2">

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>The 4000 volunteers of this colony are likely, by a very small contribution of each member, to offer a most handsome accumulative sum towards the enterprise, an example, which the ladies trust, will be followed in the other colonies. The pupils of schools, encouraged by Mr. Bonwick, have commenced to offer their share to the expedition fund. Through a series of lectures thoughtfully arranged by Mr. Stutzer, and in which the gentleman who first of all set out searching for Leichhardt, will take a part, a fair subsidy is likely to be realised. By an amateur concert, probably under the direction of an intimate friend of Leichhardt, and in which some of the ladies of the committee gracefully intend to take an active part,<note xml:id="ftn3" type="footnote" n="3">

The time was ill-chosen, for it was far too late in the season to expect even reasonably fine weather, consequently the attendance was very small, and the bleak northerly winds and threatening rain prevented anything like enjoyment. The concert itself was doubtless good as regards the quality of the performers, but few indeed cared to stand to be chilled while listening to singing, the effect of which was lost in the boisterous weather…. The list of vocal performers included the names of Madame Stuttaford, Miss G. Warden, Miss Liddle, Miss S. Mortley, and Mr. W. H. Williams.'</p>
               </note> something material may be added to the search fund. Many most generous contributions have moreover been obtained already; and hence the enterprise may be considered as secured, especially as after so much publicly evinced sympathy, of which the press has been the most powerful exponent, a hope has been held out for a Parliamentary subsidy from more than one of the Australian colonies — a subsidy which a general friendly support from the colonists will induce our rulers with so much more readiness to afford, and which, it is hoped, will finally be granted by all the Australian Governments.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>It is the ladies' intention to entrust the command of their expedition only to a leader, whose acknowledged experience, zeal, and fitting requirements are a guarantee for the safety of his movements, and for perseverance in his responsible duties. He will be bound to the obligation to lay the whole results of his investigations before the ladies' committee, which throughout will exercise an undivided supremacy over the enterprise.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>Gentlemen practically acquainted with the requirements of Australian exploration, and who carry full public confidence with them, will be consulted on whatever will be essential for the safety and success of the expedition, before the final arrangements for its departure are made; but when the ladies have appointed the leader, ample latitude will be allowed to his own as the safest judgment to organise his party, and to provide for its lengthened search operation in the field, in which arrangements every explorer of recognised ability should follow to some extent his individual views.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>No enterprise will ever have been more guarded by intelligence, activity and solicitude, than the ladies after carefully weighing all sought advice, are likely to bestow on the surveillance of this expedition. It would, however, be as wrong to burden on the fair promoters and sole guardians of this lofty cause any more toil than is absolutely needed. Hence all highminded inhabitants of Australia should not allow the ladies to renew their calls for aid, but freely, and rather spontaneously, offer their gifts. Assuredly none of the pastoral tenants will withhold from the ladies' enterprise the value of a single fleece, or exclude themselves entirely from the support of this work of humanity! But what is intended should be done without procrastination.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>The season most favourable for despatching the party with their dromedaries from the Murray River to the north is rapidly advancing, and the expedition should have the advantage, as Mr. MacIntyre judiciously suggests, leaving the Flinders River not later than September, in following Leichhardt on his westerly course. Allow me, therefore, sir, in the name of the ladies, to appeal for unity of purpose, and for disinterested and speedy support of their enterprise, not only specially to the squatting population, but also to the men of feeling of all classes; and let us not be forgetful that the whole intellectual world will be watching this movement, and that national indifference will be resented by historic judgement.</p>
