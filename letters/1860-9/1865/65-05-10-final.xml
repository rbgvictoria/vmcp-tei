Mr. Alexander Mackenzie undertook to visit certain localities in which rust prevailed, with a view of effecting the most judicious selection of samples of soil and cereals required for examination, and to institute such inquiries as only by ocular observation on the spot could be made. Mr. Mackenzie's field labors extended over a period of five months, and in his special report to the Board he has furnished some interesting notes on various points which impressed themselves on his observation during the inspection of the growing crops.

In the progress of this writing, we shall draw attention to several points of inquiry worthy of future observation and experiment, and shall succinctly allude to several of the scientific principles on which rational farming depends. Though this may be deemed a deviation from the subject allotted to our investigation, we are still persuaded that these principles, nevertheless, should neither be neglected nor misunderstood, if we hope to produce field-fruits in so normal and so healthy a condition as is likely to secure them from invasion of disease.</p>

But it became a duty of the Committee to collect for its report once more all the well established facts which present themselves as elucidating the subject before us, although to these general attention has been drawn, in most instances, long ago, in agricultural literature here as well as abroad.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>The main evidence before us, as far as bearing on this part of the question, points to the necessity of early sowing as one of the most needful measures to secure, in seasons of rust, the safety of wheat crops in this country. It is evidently preferable to incur the increased expenditure of breaking up the soil in dry weather, than to sacrifice time by postponing the preparation of the soil under the advantage of its saturation with rain. In a few instances, a recommendation to the reverse has been advanced, and it has been urged that early sown crops are proportionately more prolific in stems and foliage than in seeds. As, however, by the process of early tillage, the cereals advance into flower before excessive heat sets in, we are likely to secure the crop against those sudden enormous vicissitudes of the temperature which are prone to produce vulneration of the epidermal tissues, under their sudden alternate expansion and contraction, particularly should wetness be followed by great heat. In the sap eliquescent from points of mechanical ruptures, especially if this sap should not contain the needful proportions of incombustible elements, the seeds or spores of the rust fungus are as readily absorbed as brought into germination.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>Should the weather, particularly in wet season, continue in such cases moist and warm, we will find a prodigious number of rust plants developed in rapid succession, with amazing swiftness maturing their seeds, and diffusing them over, perhaps, wide tracts of country.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>The accumulation of these minute vegetating parasites, especially on the stems of the cereal, impedes the free flow of the sap, and, in consuming and arresting it, prevents the young and weak fruit spikes to assimilate the needful nutriment during that advanced season of the year when the rust fungus usually commits its ravages; while, in early sown crops, the grain will have absorbed already what is mainly needed for its assimilation and final maturation, and thus much more readily withstand the assailing fungus. Moreover, from early sowing, the additional advantage will be derived of securing in this climate the field fruits against such occasionally excessive droughts as will militate against their perfection.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>A second point of importance for guarding against the detrimental effects of the rust, is to be sought in the choice of those varieties of wheat which are early ripening, and are armed with the strongest coating of epidermal silicious deposits, and which otherwise are distinguished for their hardiness.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>All the so-called red varieties, and all the early maturing kinds, are therefore more eligible immediately after periods of rust. It seems preferable to forego, at least temporarily, the advantage of cultivating the more prolific but also more tender varieties, when we know that these also so much easier fall the prey of fungus growth.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>But still more important is the fact, over and over proved on Victorian fields, according to the information gained by Mr. Mackenzie from many a farmer, and according to numerous specimens selected and transmitted by him, that seeds of rusted wheat, in most instances, produced a richer yield than crops raised from the best of imported grain, the latter, we need not say, taken from plants free of rust. This apparent anomaly, rendered known, we believe, only through the experience of the past season, is, as yet, not satisfactorily explained. It suggests itself, however, to our understanding, how, probably, crops may arise quite of moderate fertility, from emaciated grains in rich soil; while from the seeds of a cereal grown in soil of a different geological origin, abnormal or even over-luxuriating crops may be produced, apt to be carried off by disease.</p>

This singular fact clearly demonstrates that the occurrence of rust is not dependent on climatic conditions alone, but more likely on the effect and reaction of a variety of causes and of circumstances, none in themselves, perhaps, sufficient to produce the disaster.

Mr. Johnson, with great propriety, points to the desirability of adding to such soils lime, not merely to render it available as such, but also to liberate by decomposition from the clays silic acid and alumina, as well as potash and magnesia. To offer the phosphoric acid and the alkaline and earthy bases necessary for a grain soil, either crushed bones, or, for speedier action, hypophosphate of lime or any kind of guano rich in phosphates, or even merely well-collected and well-prepared farm-yard manure, should be employed. We cannot refrain from dwelling on this subject, inasmuch as soils deficient in any of the requisite alkalies, in alkaline earths, and in phosphoric acid, cannot possible produce a normal crop, nor indeed a plentiful yield of grain. The cereal thus arising under insufficient nutrition cannot be constitutionally so vigorous as to withstand equally well the inclemency of weather or the temperature, or the humidity of a season, or the abrupt alterations in the air, which are not unfrequently concomitant to the invasion of rust, as those cereals strengthened under normal assimilation of abundant incombustible food.</p>

But this law shows also, how very imperfectly can be relied on the action of capillarity for bringing the incombustible elements of food of vegetation into contact with the roots of plants, and how needful it becomes to bring from the deep strata, wherever available, the assimilable elements, after any exhaustion of the surface soil, into action, unless (and it is rarely so) re-fertilisation holds the scale to abstraction.</p>

He thinks that ammonia would suspend the oxydising power of the ozone.<note xml:id="ftn17" type="footnote" n="17">

Besides the large quantity of potash which in the majority of cases such ashes contain, they yield also generally a considerable portion of phosphate of lime and magnesia. For root-crops especially, an application of potash to the soil will always prove of great benefit. Though the quantities of potash are varying in different plants to some extent, according to the mineral constituents of the spot, it will be of interest to observe that the results of the examination of some specimens kindly contributed by Mr. Johnson, proves at least several of our timber trees rich in potassa.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>The undersigned, on another occasion, dwelt already at some length on the ruinous effects which the extensive prevalence of the present spoliation system of culture in this country will unavoidably entail on our arable land. He deems it his duty to pass, on this subject, here again a few warning words, not merely because the failures of crops seem in very many instances clearly traceable to the infertility of the land, but because in glancing around we become everywhere cognizant that the very means for the restoration of the fertility of the soil are often absolutely wasted by want of foresight, circumspectness, and exertion. Let us instance alone the enormous loss which is continually sustained in the waste of the sewage and liquid and solid egesta of centres of population. It suffices not to adopt rotations of crops, which only partially, under the present Australian system of farming, will return to the soil the very elements of incombustible food without which cultivation will finally become extinct. It is equally useless to rely on resting of the land by fallow for its re-invigoration. Unless consumption of the food of plants drawn from a soil stands in a fixed relation to the means of restoration; absolute unproductiveness will only be deferred in the same degree as the natural incombustible food of such land may hold out. To restore, from sterility, land to fertility, when even finally its lower strata have been exhausted, will become as difficult as unprofitable. We shall at last have to look to imported restoratives, when pastoral pursuits will but sparingly afford them, and, finally, misery and famine, with all their terrors, can no longer be obviated. The true maxim should be for agriculturists to aim at a full retention or even augmentation of the fertility of their land, and thus to afford, not merely for the present, but also for futurity, the means of realising from each square acre of ground the largest possible uninterrupted return of field fruit for the support of an ever-increasing population.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>The agriculturist should also be warned of the ruin to which, unavoidably, he will expose his land by taxing it with the continued growth of those crops the most remunerative at the time, without provision having been made for the reparation of the losses his soil thereby constantly sustains. The cultivation of commercial plants, such as tobacco, hops, flax, hemp, mustard, as well as of leguminous plants and others, unless under judicious arrangements for the reservation of the strength of the land, becomes the most dangerous. So, for instance, it is hopeless to obtain a crop of tobacco whenever we have neither potash and magnesia, nor, especially, lime and soda within our reach. The most lucrative farming also most rapidly exhausts the soil, by the production of corn and flesh, as Liebig warns us, to the greatest extent possible,<note xml:id="ftn19" type="footnote" n="19">

Undoubtedly it is the object to produce the largest means of sustenance on any given space, but assuredly this should not be done at the expense of future generations. On the subject of restorative means for husbandry, whether viewed as advantageous in the abstract, or as sheltering, perhaps against vegetable epidemics, ample scope exists for legislation.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>Local consumption of commodities, from the residue of which fertilising agents can be obtained, will always be, to a thoughtfully reflecting community, a subject of the utmost importance. Hence factories of oil, starch, spirits, &amp;c., if they could be more generally established throughout the land, would confer lasting benefits. Under such and other judicious arrangements the agriculturist need not look to the importation of foreign fertilisers. Night soil, the most important of all manuring agents, is in this country largely lost for the re-fertilisation of our fields.</p>
