                        <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>Dr Hooker's letter by the last mail was very welcome. I will endeavour to reply to it by the next mail. It is very sad that Mueller should so far forget himself as to write in the manner described by Dr Hooker to him &amp; Bentham. You see, he is in Australia a Triton among minnows [Shakespeare, </seg>
                     <seg style="font-style: italic; ">Coriolanus</seg>
                     <seg style="">, III, 1, 88], and has but slender notions of larger aquatic beings in the great world in which he is not moving. — If he ever takes a voyage to Europe he will soon find out his mistakes, &amp; will, also I trust, acknowledge them.— What he feels is that Bentham is crumpling up his botanical reputation, and he can't manage to find the process agreeable, — however necessary it may be. — It is a pity we have no ultimate standard of appeal. But if old Brown's ghost, excessively enlightened in the mysteries of terrestrial &amp; infernal science, were to revisit the earth, bringing with him a complete herbarium of the flora of Hades, there are many botanists who would spurn his dicta, and say "Ah! That old fellow forgets the progress we have made since his day!" — Where everything in the way of definition depends upon such delicate observation of such delicate differences of structure, there must &amp; will ever be great differences of opinion in the matter; for no two men would give the same description even of a haystack.

We all commit blunders and make false determinations besides overlooking articles and observations scattered over the very extensive botanical litterature, and as I am very thankful to have mine pointed out and corrected, so I am accustomed to do the same to others without taking or ever dreaming of giving offence. With the extensive collections of authentic specimens at hand, we have superior means of identifying plants than many others, and therefore I have been more communicative about identifications than I ought to have been — but it was all with the best intentions and as to circumscription of genera and species it is now a settled thing that no two naturalists ever agree on the subject. I regret much however that you should have found reason to be so thoroughly dissatisfied with the execution of my second volume that you find my genera miserable, my distinction of species often ridiculous and my diagnoses unavailable for practical use.<note xml:id="ftn7" type="footnote" n="7">

               </note> I am also much taken up with the proofs of <name key="Leguminosae">Leguminosae</name> for Genera Plantarum. I have however nearly finished <name key="Chamaelaucieae">Chamaelaucieae</name> and Beckea and in a box just sent from Kew I have had put in your parcels of <name key="Verticordia">Verticordia</name> Calythrix <name key="Darwinia">Darwinia</name> and small genera of <name key="Chamaelaucieae">Chamaelaucieae</name> but have kept back the one which contained Thryptomene &amp; <name key="Lhotzkya">Lhotzkya</name> until I have finished Baeckea with which as you know the former is so closely connected. These plants have taken me very much longer than I anticipated. It was bad enough with Calythrix which I found impossible to determine without analyzing flowers of more than 150 specimens, the internal structure of the calyx not always to be judged of from the outside forming in my opinion one of the best specific characters — in some the narrow neck is solid with the style [inserted] on the disk at the top and often articulate, in others the neck is a tube with the style free within it, and in C. tetragona in the synonymy of which I quite agree with you the form of the calyx tube is different from that of every other species. Upon these I spent 6 hours a day for nearly three weeks — but when I came to Baeckea &amp; its allies it was much worse. Besides all yours the number of specimens and forms we have from Drummond and others appear to be endless, and as in Drummonds specimens especially there are usually plenty of flowers I have repeated my analysis of their minute parts over and over again before I could be satisfied — As you say the passage from Thryptomene to Baeckea is very gradual. Schauers genera, I agree with you, are good for nothing. He has generally taken his characters from one species and added others without examining them — but I have been unable to find definite characters without adopting rather more genera than you have — that is 1. Thryptomene 2. <name key="Homalocalyx">Homalocalyx</name> F. Muell. with the ovary of Thryptomene ([placenta] with a basal or lateral placenta) but the deciduous petals and pluriceriate stamens of Calythrix &amp; <name key="Lhotzkya">Lhotzkya</name>. 3. a new genus for <name key="Imbricaria%20ciliata">Imbricaria ciliata</name> Sm.

               </note> locular ovary but the placenta as in Calythrix &amp; <name key="Lhotzkya">Lhotzkya</name> is filiform extending from the base to the top of the cavity (being I should think a rudimentary dissepiment) with the ovules suspended from the summit — I was in hopes this genus might have been the <name key="Eremopyxis">Eremopyxis</name> of Baillon — but I find that his plant — most accurately described, is <name key="Thryptomene%20saxicola">Thryptomene saxicola</name> not uncommon in botanic gardens and which by some mistake must be labelled at Paris <name key="Baeckea%20camphorata">Baeckea camphorata</name> instead of B. saxicola a mistake which the slightest glance at the figures of the plants would have enabled Baillon to detect at once. If I do not find any name already given to this genus I propose to call it <name key="Micromyrtus">Micromyrtus</name>. 4 Scholtzia, a still further step towards Baeckea the ovary being usually completely 2 locular with 2 superposed ovules in each cell. In a species from Sharks Bay however the dissepiment appears to me to be incomplete, but very little more than the filiform placenta of <name key="Micromyrtus">Micromyrtus</name> but with 2 superposed ovules on each side, and the style inserted in a tubular depression in the centre of the ovary as in Scholtzia and most Baeckeas. It appears to me that S. decandra and S. denticulata must be refered to Thryptomene the former being the true T. saxicola Schau[.] 5 Baeckea in which with you I would include <name key="Babingtonia">Babingtonia</name> [and] <name key="Euryomyrtus">Euryomyrtus</name>

It is true that the anthers may well divide the genus into two <name key="Babingtonia">Babingtonia</name> and Baeckea but they are too little naturally different as far as I now see to be considered as more than sections. In all this however I may change my mind again before I have done — I am now getting quite tired of these troublesome little flowers</p>

               <name key="Myrtaceae">Myrtaceae</name> will probably occupy me for several months yet — I may be mistaken about getting <name key="Compositae">Compositae</name> into vol. lll but I am pledged to make it a thick one. I must contrive to get in about 700 pages and about 1400 species — <name key="Euphorbiaceae">Euphorbiaceae</name> I cannot think of — if not in <name key="Monochlamydeae">Monochlamydeae</name> they go next to <name key="Malvaceae">Malvaceae</name> &amp; <name key="Sterculiaceae">Sterculiaceae</name> — <name key="Loranthaceae">Loranthaceae</name> I think must go down to <name key="Monochlamydeae">Monochlamydeae</name> next to <name key="Santalaceae">Santalaceae</name>. If as you say there are not above 100 Eucalypti <name key="Myrtaceae">Myrtaceae</name> must I suppose be estimated at about 700 and allowing 200 for the smaller families would leave 500 for <name key="Compositae">Compositae</name> — but it is impossible to estimate numbers till they are worked up. Of <name key="Chamaelaucieae">Chamaelaucieae</name> Scholtzia &amp; Baeckea I now make up nearly 180.
