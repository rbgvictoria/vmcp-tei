But beyond the claims of humanity, I can advance for the ladies' enterprise that of great practical importance and utility. To a clear-seeing statesman like yourself, it will be but too apparent that, with exploration, settlement will be advanced, and with the spread of settled habitations, the commerce of centres of populations and metropolitan localities especially.

It seems likely that M is alluding to the high death rates in England in the very cold winter of 1864/5; English press comments on the Registrar General's quarterly reports for the periods ending 31 December 1864 and 31 March 1865 included 'A sever and protracted winter, with scarlatina and fever, swelled the mortuary returns' and the monthly average temperatures for the quarter were lower than for the previous 25 years (<seg style="font-style: italic; ">Bury and Norwich post and Suffolk herald</seg>, 9 May 1865, supplement).</p>

We all feel that Queensland — in which almost every mountain system and conflux of rivers speaks of Leichhardt — would bear the main share of the expenditure of this noble philanthropic work; and indeed, support of it has been offered to the ladies. But several thousand pounds will be needed to equip and maintain a party for two years; and as the calls on the revenue of that young Colony must be multifarious, the aid of the other Australian Governments is invoked by the fair apostles of Leichhardt's cause. South Australia, with its usual generosity, has pledged itself to the support of this expedition already. If you allow me to add to the advocacy of this appeal of the ladies, it would be — that whatever you and your honored colleagues may be pleased to do, may be done <seg style="font-style: italic; ">immediately</seg>, in order that the services of Mr. M'Intyre, who is designated for the command of the Ladies' Expedition, may not be lost, nor the season most advantageous for bringing the dromedaries to the Leichhardt River.<note xml:id="ftn10" type="footnote" n="10">

It Britain sends out its navigators again to traverse the North Pole, assuredly Australia should be stimulated to have the geographical map of its great, rich and hospitable territory completed; and it will reflect credit of the most luminous and lasting kind on all those who will engage in the accomplishment of this great object, so great, so good, so recommendable to our young nation.</p>
