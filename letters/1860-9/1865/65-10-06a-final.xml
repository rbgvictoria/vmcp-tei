F. Barlee, intimating that, by order of His Excellency Governor Hampton, a constable had been purposely despatched to the Murchison River, to ascertain the truthfulness of a report there afloat, that, according to the sayings of the natives, a party of Europeans coming from the East had perished on the upper part of that river. The inquiries of Constable Watson among the aborigines, confirmed by Mons. de Bibra, a pastoral tenant of the remotest station of the locality, disproves entirely the rumour. ['Mons. de Bibra' is almost certainly C. L. von Bibra, who settled in the area in which Augustus Oldfield collected for M in 1859 (see B59.12.01, p. 209 under <seg style="font-style: italic; ">Halgania bebrana</seg>). It could, however, be his brother F. L. von Bibra, who joined him some time during 1865.]</p>

                     <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>The article concludes by discussing various reports of the progress of McIntyre's 1864 expedition published in the UK press, including the <seg style="font-style: italic; ">Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society</seg>, vol. 9, No. 6, pp. 300- 5, and the <seg style="font-style: italic; ">Athenaeum</seg> (23 September 1865, pp. 408-9), that gave a long summary of a paper read to the Geography and Ethnology section of the meeting of the British Association, '"M'Intyres journey across Australia and discovery of traces of Leichhardt" by Dr. F. <seg style="font-variant: small-caps; ">Mueller </seg>(Melbourne)'. The attribution of the paper to M is doubtful; it is very similar to the account in the <seg style="font-style: italic; ">Proceedings</seg> of the RGS, which was stated to have been 'communicated by Dr. Mueller'.</p>
