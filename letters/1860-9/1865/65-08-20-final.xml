               </note> Dr Hooker refers to the Herbarium &amp; thought it most advisable to offer it to N.S.Wales, because in <seg style="">
                  <hi rend="underline">Queensland</hi>
               </seg> and in Victoria existed collections, but not in N.S. Wales. I fear Mr Moore will feel hurt, because he has continued to form a collection and added to what his Department possessed, while at least a few years ago there were no plant collections (dried) at Brisbane whatever, nor do I think there any now and certainly Mr Moores Library is much larger than that at Brisbane. As for my own collection, compared to that of Queensland, if really one exists there, I must say, that I have brought it up to about 350,000 specimens, and consider it unique in the southern hemisphere. — I say this not with any desire to do injustice to Mr Hill, with whom I continue friendly relations but because I am aware, that Mr Hills labours are lying in a direction, which renders it beyond his power to devote time to bot. studies. Whether anything can be done to secure Prof Lindleys bot specimina also, I cannot say. I fear not. The sum is too large, and every successive Ministry is eager to avoid incurring <seg style="">
                  <hi rend="underline">new</hi>
               </seg> items of expenditure. Nevertheless Sir Charl. Nicholson or Dr Hooker might adress Sir Charl Darling on the subject &amp; give an explicit account of the extent of the collection, i.e. the approximate number of specimens, the fasciles of orders &amp;c. I write on this subject at length, being persuaded, that poor Lindley is enjoying your full sympathy, &amp; that you will gladly in your generous disposition aid him, wherever it can be done, especially as so many of your thought[s] must be consociated with his labours during 50 years and more.<note xml:id="ftn11" type="footnote" n="11">
