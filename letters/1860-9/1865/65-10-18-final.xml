I am now in the thick of Eucalyptus and get perfectly confused having to go over so many specimens over and over again before I can match them. The bark character you point out may be an excellent one but unfortunately in most cases unavailable for want of accurate notes from the collectors The anthers by which you distinguish two species otherwise alike is frequently a good character but often difficult to observe. The venation a very constant one in most cases but very difficult to describe — so that with the great mass of the common N. S.

F. Mueller has proposed sections founded on the nature of the bark, of the value of which I am totally unable to judge, nor have I any means of availing myself of them, for the specimens themselves never show the character, and a large portion of them are either unaccompanied by notes of it, or the collector's notes are from various causes indefinite, unreliable, or even contradictory. I have thus been compelled to establish groups upon such characters as appeared to me the most constant among those which are supplied by the specimens ... It is to be hoped that ... Dr Mueller... from his knowledge of Gum Trees in a living state, will be able to give us a truly natural arrangement founded upon the cortical or any other system which experience may induce him to adopt.' M eventually did work up a monograph on the eucalypts, viz. B79.13.11 etc.</p>
