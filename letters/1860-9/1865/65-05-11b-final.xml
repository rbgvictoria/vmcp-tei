                     <seg style="">Extract from a letter of Mr. John Dow, dated Cambridge Downs, Flinders River, 12th Feb., 1865: — "I have enclosed some hair, which is the only thing light enough to send in a letter, out of a number of queer things which we got in a black's camp, the other day, upon the occasion of a hostile descent, which it was found necessary to make upon about 300 of them as a lesson for some of their tricks they had been playing upon one of the out-stations. The black is gins' hair, which they appear to spin by the yard, as we have a great quantity of it; but that light-coloured bit is all we find of that sort, which leads us to believe it to belong to some unfortunate explorer. At any rate it is that of some white man, as no blackfellow has hair like it. I have also the outside case of a watch, with the number 32811. It may have belonged to Burke and Wills — who knows? — as we found it in possession of the blacks."</seg>
