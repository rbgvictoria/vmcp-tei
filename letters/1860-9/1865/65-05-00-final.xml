This man has clearly no right to retain the animal, but as he has an idea that the Government cannot prove ownership, he expresses himself determined to "stick to" the camel, unless some exorbitant demand made by him be satisfied. Mr M'Donald pointed out the impropriety of retaining a beast which does not belong to him, at the same time offering to pay £10 if he would peaceably give up possession. This Findlay refused to do, adding that rather than give it up for such a sum, he would "shoot it," or "cut its throat!" He added also -and I mention this in order that the attention of the gentleman in question may be drawn to the matter— that the Hon. W. Campbell advised him (Findlay) to give the Government fourteen days notice of his intention, and then, if his demands were not met, to sell the camel by auction for his own benefit.</p>
