               </note> There has, I am sure, been no desire or wish in this country to disparage your labors — either as traveller or Botanist, indeed we have fought hard enough for you in every way: but we are not going to lose sight of justice to your predecessors, whose claims you naturally think so lightly of in comparison with your own, because in your isolated position you cannot avail yourself of them, or feel or know the opinion that is formed of them in this country. It would I am well aware be of little use to point out to you the difficulty of the efficient construction of so gigantic a Flora as that of Australia, how much tact it requires to seize prominent characters &amp; to make the diagnosis both brief diagnostic &amp; accurate, in doing which Bentham has had 40 years experience &amp; you none — nor how much advice &amp; counsel the wisest &amp; best Botanists amongst us take of one another in all these matters, before arranging a plan that is to include 8000 species so arranged and described as to be <seg style="">
                  <hi rend="underline">really useful &amp; not troublesome</hi>
               </seg>, — all this I <seg style="">
                  <hi rend="underline">assure</hi>
               </seg> you requires work of a very different character from what you have been accustomed to &amp; a head for systematic methodology that you have never felt called upon to exercise. I will tell you candidly that excellence in these matters requires deep, long study &amp; thought — without which Bentham himself would never have attained even mediocrity. For my own part I feel myself wholly unfit to cope with him &amp; should not attempt any extensive Flora that he would do, — under any circumstances. Nor do I see how you could do the work with care within a reasonable period. — Bentham who has nothing (or little) else to do, works all day long at Kew, &amp; even with Floras the most familiar to him he rarely describes more than 5 species a day including all arrangements comparisons of genera &amp;c &amp;c &amp;c — &amp; he calculates that the Australian Flora would take him 7 or 8 years at least to do it so as that his work should <seg style="">
                  <hi rend="underline">last</hi>
               </seg> &amp; the book be a standard for all time. With your multifarious duties &amp; such a work as the Victoria Flora in hand you would I am sure find it impossible to do the Australian <seg style="">

                  <hi rend="underline">circumstances</hi>
               </seg> are against your undertaking the Australian Flora far more than against mine even &amp; I had for many years set my heart upon it too but I have abandoned it long ago in favor of Bentham; because I have no time to do it justice &amp; because it would be a public calamity if it were taken out of his hands.</p>
