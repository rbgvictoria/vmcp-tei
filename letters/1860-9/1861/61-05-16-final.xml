               </note> I addressed some days since to Sir William Hooker that the question as to whether I am to be entrusted with the preparation of an Australian Flora now depends entirely upon the immediate decision of the Colonial Governments themselves. Our Colonial Office here took up the project very eagerly, and the work would I have no doubt been commenced two years since with or even without the aid of the Colonies themselves had it not been for the desire some of them shewed that these should be splendidly illustrated Floras conducted on the scale you have begun for that of Victoria, which independent of the diminished use they would be of to European botanists travellers and temporary visitors, would require far too much time and cost in their preparation for me to think of undertaking. Even now the Duke of Newcastle seemed anxious that the Australian flora should be the next of the 8vo ones to be carried out on the general plan, but the Treasury have definitely declined to sanction it under the above circumstances. The question is now whether the Colonies are really desirous of having the work done and I will still keep my engagements open till the end of this year. If by that time I do not receive the necessary authority I shall be obliged although with much regret to give up the idea altogether, and enter into further arrangements with Martius for his Brazilian Flora of which I have already done the <name key="Papilionaea">Papilionaea</name>
