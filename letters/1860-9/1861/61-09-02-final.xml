The line of palings, which separated the class ground from the experimental Garden has been removed and thereby a great improvement is effected in the view from these parts of the garden. Many plants of rarity previously not introduced into this colony were recently raised at the nurseries. Altho' so late in the season we have still been able to supply several public institutions with plants; the interchange with british and foreign institutions also continues almost uninterruptely. We acquire thus for our herbarium some fine collections of Brazil, and Russian plants from Petersburgh and Abyssinia, North American plants from London, Indian plants from Kew, Abyssinian plants from Esslingen. Several cases with living plants arrived from various localities, others were transmitted from here. Excellent pine seeds arrived from San Francisco. Much labour has been withdrawn during the month from our garden by the prearrangements of transferring the majority of the animals kept in this establishment to the Royal park, and all the female Llamas, all the Angora Goats and all the Chinese Sheep, of which 10 were introduced during the month, are already located at the park.<note xml:id="ftn2" type="footnote" n="2">
