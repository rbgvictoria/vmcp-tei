               </note> a word on so deeply an important a question. May I then, humble as I am, endeavour to strengthen, perhaps unnecessarily, the opinion, so powerfully upheld on zoological and geological grounds by yourself, that nature created species by design, in recording (as I feel to do bound), that during scarcely less than 22 years of observations of the forms of vegetable life in free nature, I had during travels extending in Europe and Australia over nearly 30,000 miles, never cause to entertain any doubt, that we are surrounded by species clearly defined in nature, all perfect in their organisation, all destined to fulfil by unalterable laws those designs for which the power of our creating god called them into existence. And I feel all the more bound to bear testimony to this great and sublime truth, since vegetative forms are much less restricted in variation than those of animal life. Hence it arose that the species of the vegetable world are so immensely overrated in number, hence the cause, that in a vast number of diagnostic definitions of plants we see what is alterable misappreciated as permanently characteristic, whereas but too many of the permanent tests of species, especially those emanating from carpology remain not sufficiently revealed. I <seg style="">
                  <hi rend="underline">have therefore no hesitation in affirming that nature in her eternal laws created always well-defined unalterable species; but those of the empire of plants are hitherto vastly overestimated in number and are greatly more variable, than phytographers have been inclined to admit!</hi>
