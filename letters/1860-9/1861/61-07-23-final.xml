You are, my dear Sir William, fully aware that I have travelled since 1847 nearly 21 000 miles by land principly with a view to render myself acquainted with the vegetation of this continent. I have moreover copious as yet uncopied notes of my diaries,<note xml:id="ftn4" type="footnote" n="4">

The fascicles of Australian plants in our botanical Museum amount already to <name key="Thalamiflorae">Thalamiflorae</name> 82, <name key="Calyciflorae">Calyciflorae</name> 240, <name key="Corolliflorae">Corolliflorae</name> 77, <name key="Monochlamydeae">Monochlamydeae</name> 85, <name key="Monocotyledoneae">Monocotyledoneae</name> 70, <name key="Acotyledoneae">Acotyledoneae</name> 35, large collections of <name key="Acotyledoneae">Acotyledoneae</name> being besides lent to European Botanists, considerable additions not yet inserted and vast additions expected from several collectors now travelling in the interior, whilst weekly or even daily numerous friends forward specimina to me.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>Nevertheless it is but right I should admit, that my multifarious official duties have during the last four years left me not even leisure enough to accomplish the task of fully digesting these collections; but since the garden, over which I hold the Directorship, will in the course of this year be finally formed in all its parts and since I shall moreover ere long be relieved of the main-administration of the zoological department, I may hope, if providence grants me life and health, to advance with my botanical labours much more speedily than before, whilst I have meanwhile put all our huge collections into perfect order and access and have to such an extent augmented my library as to enter with fair strength on future literary work. That my herbarium is devoid of very few Australian species is, I think, indisputable, and that the series of specimina is much more extensive and select than in any other herbarium I have reason to believe.</p>

I shall also be perpared to defray the cost of transmission and remission, if Mr Bentham will undertake the clearance of the consignments to and fro at London and will always secure the collections again in metal-lined carefully closed cases, when returned. I will also in my department out of a small vote, I have for the publication of my works as long as Government and Parliament sanction the continuance remit £100 for each volume, so that only £50 from South Australia, New South Wales and Queensland would be required respectively, a contribution fair in proportion to our population; and should the grants for my work be discontinued I will save the above specified sum out of my salary annually for the purpose. I will further arrange, that as far as possible diagnoses, notes on the range of species, on variation &amp;c are furnished either in print or in manuscript along with the specimina to be transmitted, establishing myself no further claims on the authorship of the flora, than some such as by mutual concession is so justly held by Dr Hooker towards the Ceylon Flora,<note xml:id="ftn9" type="footnote" n="9">

It appears to me also advantageous to sift from specific descriptions notes relative to measurements and other characters subject to wide fluctuations; nor can I recommend as long as we aim to produce an inexpensive and portabe work, that it should be encumbered with lithographies, particularly if these are not for the guidance of students accompanied by analytical details. On the other hand I believe an augmentation of the work by quotations not merely of authors of species and genera, but also of the original citat of their respective writing would be of vast instruction.</p>
