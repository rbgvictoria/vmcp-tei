Pipes are fixed at the new cistern, which receives the rain-water from the roof of the Museum-building, so that now a supply of water for horses &amp;c is available in that portion of the ground, without resorting to the tedious process of drawing it from the Yarra.</p>

Mr Heyne, who has for several years most creditably managed the work of the Palmhouse, is now amanuensis at my office and whilst relieved of a considerable portion of clerical work by this arrangement, I can concentrate in future more time upon literary work.

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>The special garden work varied so little from ordinary routine business, that I presume it will be unnecessary to specify the nature of the work. Several rare kinds of pine have sprung up in the nursery from seeds imported. Of the Abyssinian <name key="Musa%20Ensete">Musa Ensete</name>, a very gigantic Banana plant, we received a specimen from the Sydney botanic Garden together with several other valuable plants new to this establishment;— from the botanic Garden of Ceylon we received the seeds of the Musa, which furnished the fibre for the Manilla rope. The <name key="Lawsonia">Lawsonia</name>, a valuable Indian hedge plant, and the W. Australian Mahagony <name key="Eucalyptus">Eucalyptus</name> have been raised from seeds, also several valuable American oaks. We shipped to Manilla for interchange a Wardian Case with plants. From the Director of the botanic Garden of Amsterdam, Professor Miquel, and from the Director of the botanic Garden of Upsala, Professor Areschoug, we rejoyced to receive some very valuable contributions to the herbarium, contributions which after centuries will still be regarded as important, in as much as the specimens are authenticated by these great men.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>I beg to avail myself of this opportunity to solicit your approval of adding the reserve in the North side of the Yarra as a permanent possession to the area of the botanic Garden, a proposition which is favorably entertained by the honorable the President of the Board of Land and Works and also by the Gentlemen of the zoologic Committee. This piece of ground being so near the new Governments offices will often be traversed by those servants of the state, who have their private dwellings in South Yarra and Prahran; it is moreover the only basaltic ground within the area of this establishment and thereby doubly valuable as an adjunct to the gardens, whilst with the labor at our disposal we can keep the ground as a Park of rare trees readily in order without any special cost to the Government.<note xml:id="ftn5" type="footnote" n="5">

Hodgkinson, referred the file back to M on 25 October: 'to note the concurrence of the Honble the Commr of Lands &amp; Survey in the temporary reservation for addition to the Botanical Garden of site previously set apart in the use of the Zoological Society.' M returned the file to the Assistant Commissioner 'most gratefully' on 29 October, and it was returned to the Chief Secretary on 1 November.</p>
