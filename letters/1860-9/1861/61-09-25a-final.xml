               </note> Trusting that you will forgive my intruding so repeatedly on your kindness I merely now trespass yet for a moment on your few leisure moments in informing you, that I was desired by Dr Milligan of Hobarton, now staying at London, to enquire whether the meteor iron (Victorian) in possession of Mr Abel of Ballarat could be secured for the British Museum. I did so and informed Professor Owen &amp; Dr Milligan of the results of my enquiry, but as the latter Gentleman did not state, whether I should communicate with you or Prof Owen, you will allow me perhaps to state also to you, what arrangements have been made preliminary to the final disposal of the meteor-mass. It has been secured for local exhibition in Melbourne, antecedent to the London Exhibition, whence with many other articles of interest and utility it will be forwarded probably from here in December next on expense of our Exhibition Commission. After the aërolite has been exhibited at your grand show next May it would be purchasable and I believe Mr Abel will authorize his nephew Professor Abel of Woolwich,<note xml:id="ftn3" type="footnote" n="3">
