                     xml:lang="en">In the Legislative Assembly of the Victorian Parliament on 18 January 1861, in answer to a question the Chief Secretary, Richard Heales, said that the 'usual vote for the extermination of the thistles was omitted, and for the reason that no real good had arisen from this expenditure'. Another member 'was sure it would be of great service to the members of the Government if they inquired the opinion of the Government botanist respecting the proper season to destroy thistles. … Much of the money was wasted from being spent at an improper season' ('Bathurst Burr and Thistle', <seg style="font-style: italic; ">Argus</seg>, 19 June 1861, p. 6).</p>

Brooke: 'I have the honor to transmit to you a Resolution passed at a special meeting of the Council of this Board of Agriculture held this day and to request that you will be so good as to take the same into your immediate consideration. Proposed by Dr Macadam | Seconded by Mr Selwyn Resolved That the Secretary be instructed to communicate with the Hon the President of the Board of Lands and Survey the earnest recommendation of the Council of the Board of Agriculture that the Thistle Vote should be maintained as an item of national expenditure, and that the Council will if desired, place its services at the command of the Government to assist in expending the Vote in the most advantageous manner.'</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>In reference to your second question: "whether it is true, that they are fast dying out and that from this cause they will cease to be a nuisance", I beg to observe, that having travelled this season only through some of the eastern parts of the colony, I cannot state from personal observation, whether the measures adopted by the Board of Agriculture to eradicate the thistles in Victoria have been effectual; but as the Bathurst Burr is only of annual duration, and since the other thistles, which have spread as yet over Victoria, are only of biennial life, their growth could be materially surpressed<note xml:id="ftn3" type="footnote" n="3">

               </note> by preventing the latter for two years and the Bathurst Burr during one year to shed their seeds, altho' thereby not at once the entire annihilation of these plants could be effected, in as much as some scattered seeds may remain dormant in the ground for several years.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>In reply to your third question: "what remedy could be suggested to extirpate the thistles" I beg to express my opinion, that not only the thistle act should be rigorously enforced, but also that this should be done precisely at that time, when in the various districts the thistles and burrs are forming their flowers. To effect this satisfactorily I would recommend the cutting of thistles on the crownlands by tender, limiting the work to that period, when it alone can be effective. To destroy these plants there seems however no method available less costly and tedious, than cutting them individually by manual labour.</p>
