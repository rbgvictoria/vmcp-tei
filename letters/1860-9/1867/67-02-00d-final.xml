               </note> referred to the charms of dense copses of elms, so much planted in middle Europe. It should be remembered, however, that there no foliage is required whilst the snow falls; and that here an exclusive planting of deciduous trees would impart a wintry appearance — undesirable at any season. Thus elms, and other deciduous trees, are here mainly fitted for interspersion, or for interplanting, at regular distances. Besides, they will only prosper where they are not exposed to the full violence of the hot winds; and they need an abundance of water. Irrigation applied once a week to the elms in the Botanic-gardens keeps them barely alive. For more extended lines in these gardens the water cannot be obtained until another main from the Yan Yean reservoir brings a larger supply. The eucalyptii interplanted between the elms have outgrown the latter thrice in rapidity; but wherever the sewage goes to waste — as on a good many of our unplanted municipal reserves — the growth of elms, willows, spreading poplars, and other umbrageous deciduous trees should certainly be encouraged, along with that of evergreen trees. The cows kept on these reserves — to the hindrance of all planting operations from year to year — are assuredly not sufficient to supply with milk one-hundredth part of the inhabitants of Melbourne. With the facilities of bringing by rail milk and other farm produce from a distance, we should follow the example of London, Edinburgh, and other great European cities, and turn our metropolitan reserves to better account than cow pastures.</p>
