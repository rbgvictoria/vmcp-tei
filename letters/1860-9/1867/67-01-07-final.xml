               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>Feeling convinced that so enlightened a Council as that of the City of Melbourne will be ready to promote by any collateral aid the extension &amp; preservation of the park-plantations around the metropolis, I do not hesitate to recommend for the Councils favorable consideration that the Yarra Park may be abandoned as a grazing ground and so excellent and lovely a locality be further embellished by tree-plantations. Under any circumstances all my efforts to decorate my northern reserve with avenues will be paralyzed, unless the cattle are removed from the adjoining land &amp; the exclusion of these and goats &amp; other pastoral animals be rigorously enforced. I may mention, that four or five years ago the Government relinquished the rent, previously raised for depasturing on the reserve between the City bridge &amp; the botanic Garden in order that the valuable land near the city might be rendered more useful than that of an ordinary pasture. By this wise measure, I was enabled to convert several hundred acres to an incipient pine &amp; oak forest and draw through it numerous avenue lines, of which the citizens now already derive great advantage. The small income levied from grazing fees on such land, I respectfully submit, is entirely out of proportion to the disadvantages arising from loss of time in forming the needful plantation and from more or less destruction of whatever may have been raised in the neighbourhood. Besides the time of my employees is most dishearteningly taxed in keeping at least to some extent the invading cattle from their ground. If my own improvements on the north-ground are not to be frustrated and if avenues are next season to be formed in the yarra-park, I must respectfully advise the immediate discontinuance of the grazing on that spot and the slight repair needed at the Punt road fences.<note xml:id="ftn2" type="footnote" n="2">
