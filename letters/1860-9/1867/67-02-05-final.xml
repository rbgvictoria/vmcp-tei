               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>The first condition to accomplish this object is the necessity of rigourously excluding all cattle goats and other pastoral animals from access to the drifting sand and its vicinity in order to prevent the natural vegetation which binds together the rolling sands from being destroyed.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>The vegetation to be established must consist of plants with long creeping roots and must of course comprise species adapted for sandy ridges. On the adjoining flats however seacoast firs <name key="Pinus%20pinaster">Pinus pinaster</name> and <name key="Pinus%20maritima">Pinus maritima</name> should be planted and if our native coast <name key="Casuarina">Casuarina</name> is planted (Sheoak) it will aid in establishing wood. For the sand ridges themselves it may be found most convenient to choose such native plants as we see originally covering the hummocks. I would especially point to the <name key="Mesembryanthemum">Mesembryanthemum</name> (vernacularly called pigscheek) which by dray loads can be brought from adjoining localities to the Sand. In Denmark I noticed that the inhabitants of such coast parts as I visited planted the reedy native sand grasses which have long underground roots, on any spot which became bare of vegetation. Similar reedy grasses are wild on our own coast. It will also be advisable to disseminate the Australian Couch grass (<name key="Cynodon%20Dactylon">Cynodon Dactylon</name>) which delights in sandy soil and forms closely matted patches.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>Indeed it would still be better to plant as soon as the cool weather sets in this grass extensively by transferring it to the locality in a growing state. Perennial grasses of any kind should be sown in the vicinity of the sand. The seeds of these are cheaply available in our warehouses The sand tea tree (<name key="Fabricia%20laevigata">Fabricia laevigata</name>) so common on most parts of the coast should be sown on the flats adjoining the sand. For this purpose the seeds can be most readily collected in large quantities by any gardener. Ground might be ploughed for its reception. But all these operations become of no avail unless the ground be fenced.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>A third condition to secure the Town against the inroads of the sand is the appointment of a zealous and intelligent man to exercise a constant vigilance over the young plantations and to prevent the access of cattle &amp;c also the unnecessary traversing of the sand.

The broom which sprung up first serves the double purpose of further restraining the sand and of nursing the young pines and the foliage of the latter after a growth of seven or eight years under shelter of the broom becoming annually mingled with the sand tends to fertilize it. After this period the pine overtops the broom and frequently entirely kills it with its shade. In ten or twelve years the rising forest is thinned for the manufacture of tar and for procuring branches to cover the newly sown districts. After twenty years have passed a fall of the trees commences for the manufacture of resin. Thus these forests placed on the dunes or drifting sand hills between the mouths of the Adour and the Garonne shelter the whole country behind them from the inroads of the element from the sea and yield themselves a supply of an important article of commerce.<note xml:id="ftn5" type="footnote" n="5">

Hider thought M's plan would probably entail considerable expense, and the Council could not expect any financial assistance from the Government. Consequently he suggested a simplified version of M's plan be adopted whereby the space fenced in by the Council would be divided into about 25 sections which would be allotted to any persons willing to take charge of them for the purpose of improvement. To encourage these citizens in their work the Council would award monetary prizes for the three best sections (£10, £5, £3) at the end of three years (<seg style="font-style: italic; ">Warrnambool examiner,</seg> 15 February 1867).</p>
