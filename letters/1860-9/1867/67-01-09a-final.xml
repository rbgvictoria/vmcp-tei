               </note> the discovery of a new species of cassowary in Northern Queensland, I was unaware that the discovery was only so far a new one, as through Mr. Rand. Johnson’s notes we were enabled to point to positive characters by which the Casuarius Johnsonii could be distinguished from C. galeatus. For since the announcement of Mr. Johnson’s discovery it has been kindly pointed out to me by my friend Dr. G. Bennett, of Sydney, who has shed so much light on the zoology of East Australia and the Pacific Isles, that the Australian cassowary was first seen during Kennedy’s disastrous expedition. Dr. Bennett refers to an extract of the <seg style="font-style: italic; ">Illustrated Sydney Herald</seg>, published many years back, and to a quotation in <seg style="font-style: italic; ">Gould’s Handbook of the Birds of Australia</seg> (II., 206). The illustrious ornithologist observes— “Although no specimen of this bird has been brought before the scientific world, we cannot, I think, doubt that a species of this form really exists in the northern parts of Australia, but whether it be identical with some previously described species inhabiting New Guinea and the neighbouring islands, or entirely new, must for the present remain an open question.” Dr. Bennett further remarks, that the feathers used for ornamentation by the natives of Weymouth Bay were recognised by Jukes (<seg style="font-style: italic; ">Narrative of Voyage of Fly</seg>, I, 155) as cassowary feathers, supposed, however, to be obtained from New Guinea.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>On reference to Carron’s tragical account of Kennedy’s expedition, I notice an entry in his journal to this effect:— “Nov. 4, 1848.— This morning Jackey went to examine a scrub through which we wanted to pass, and while out shot a fine cassowary. It was very dark and heavy, not so long on the legs as the common emu, and had a larger body, shorter neck, with a large, red, stiff, horny comb on its head. Mr. Wall skinned it, but from the many difficulties with which we had to contend the skin was spoiled before it could be properly preserved.”</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>The characters of the bird here sketched out are in entire consonance with the ordinary Indian cassowary. Hence it was reserved to Mr. Randall Johnson to afford the means of indicating for the first time at least some of the diagnostic distinctions of Casuarius Johnsonii.<note xml:id="ftn3" type="footnote" n="3">
