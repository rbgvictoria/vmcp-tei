               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>Dr Mueller would be glad if the Health Committee could at once grant to him the authorization to shoot all the Goats which may be trespassing in the portion of Yarra Park before mentioned, he would also beg to call the attention of the Health Committee to the fact that the existing native trees in the Park are much infected with Miseltoe and that some steps should be taken to remove this parasite as otherwise it will in conjunction with the continued trampling of cattle round the roots of the trees cause the death of the many fine specimens of Eucalyptus growing in the Park. Dr Mueller would further urge upon the attention of the Committee the fact that improvements already made and many further ones which he has in contemplation are frustrated by the presence of cattle in Yarra Park (south) as these animals are continually swimming (especially at night) round the fence of the old Zoological Reserve and destroying the shrubs and trees there planted.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>Dr Mueller would further beg to urge upon the Committee the dirty state of the Cottage opposite Branders ferry, occupied by an employee of the Melbourne Corporation. This cottage appears from the opposite side of the river to be a great blot upon the landscape in the direction of Melbourne. Dr Mueller would urge upon the Committee that this cottage should be fenced round and shrubs planted though the fencing may be dispensed with in the event of cattle being removed from the Park. The shrubs necessary for this purpose Dr Mueller will be happy to place at the disposal of the Health Committee.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>Dr Mueller would also beg of the Health Committee that they would order the persons living in the Cottage before named to dry their clothes away from the house as Dr Mueller has been frequently annoyed at the sight of linen hanging in Yarra Park and as Dr Mueller does not permit any of the employees of the Botanic Garden to hang out or dry linen on the premises he thinks that his request in this matter is not unreasonable. This matter and the former ones connected with the cottage Dr Mueller is particularly anxious about, they were forcibly brought under notice very lately while the Governors of New South Wales and Victoria were with Dr Mueller inspecting the pine plantations formed on the southern side of the Yarra, and Dr Mueller thinks that for the credit of the City of Melbourne they should be remedied before the arrival of the Duke of Edinburgh.<note xml:id="ftn3" type="footnote" n="3">

               </note> Dr Mueller is also very anxious to improve and beautify the footpath leading from the new Botanic Gardens Bridge to the Melbourne Railway but as his resources are very limited and the area over which they have to be spread is large he would respectfully ask of the Health Committee to grant him some small pecuniary assistance similar to that which has on two former occasions been readily granted for the purpose thus named. The necessary superintendence and other supplementary assistance Dr Mueller will willingly himself provide.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>Dr Mueller would urge upon the Committee that permission should be given to him to remove the old three Rail Fence at Princes Bridge which runs through the centre of the swamp on the southern side of the river about 100 feet or so from the St Kilda road on the Botanic Gardens side, and that the roadway leading down to this swamp from the St Kilda Road and also the dry arches of Princes Bridge might be fenced across so as to enable the bank of St Kilda Road and the swamp before named to be planted with Willows and Poplars or other suitable trees. Dr Mueller would urge upon the Committee the fact that this swamp is now no longer required as a watering place for cattle, as the supplies of Yan Yean are everywhere available and abundant, that the cattle are continually obtaining an entrance to the Govt House Reserve through this source, that negotiations are now in progress between Dr Mueller and the Committee of the Immigrants Home for the removal of the cattle belonging to the Home, and that it is very desirable that the present planting season should not be lost. The planting would lessen the effect of floods upon the St Kilda Roadway would beautify the landscape of the City and Dr Mueller having specially reserved a number of fine plants for such purposes confidently hopes to obtain the co-operation of the Health Committee in this matter.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>Dr Mueller would beg to request that more stringent measures may be adopted to prevent the continued trespassing of cattle on the St Kilda Road, the fence of the Govt House Reserve being at this place very bad and the votes of Parliament for fencing &amp;c in the Botanic Gardens not yet being passed, the cattle from the Road are continually entering the Reserve and doing a great deal of damage to the many valuable plants there planted. Dr Mueller has frequently been obliged to put cattle out with his own hands while the only gardener who can be spared to attend to this Reserve has to sit up during most of the night as well as being actively employed during the day.</p>
