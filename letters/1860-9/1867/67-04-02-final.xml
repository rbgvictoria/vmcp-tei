               </note> Is it really impossible for the City Council to abandon the land near to mine as pasture ground? &amp; are the residents allowed near to it to turn their animals into any public plantation with impunity? If the old fence on the Yarra towards Richmond was sold, it would furnish fund to secure the punt road properly against goats &amp;c &amp; for a mere trifle a few nice paths could be struck out through the grassland between the Cricket Ground &amp; Punt road; these,—if the corporation would have sunk holes at 5d or 6d each—, could be planted easily in May or at the end of April with Avenue trees, which [I] could <seg style="">
                  <hi rend="underline">then</hi>
               </seg> but not subsequently furnish. Pray take also kindly into consideration, whether the old wooden unsightly cottage should be moved, now occupied by the woman selling fruit. It is a great eye sore at the beautiful bridge; besides she keeps the neighbourhood of the place so <seg style="">
                  <hi rend="underline">untidy</hi>
               </seg> and has generally <seg style="">
                  <hi rend="underline">goats</hi>
               </seg> dogs &amp;c at large. I think it would be far better to have such a fruit-booth constructed of Brick &amp; if a small building was constructed on the City Councils expense it could be let at a weekly rental &amp; would bring a fair return. The building should now be constructed nearer to the Railway station &amp; on the other side of the path. I would also ask for a grant of fifteen (£15.- .-) to plant the approach to the iron-bridge; but this would of course be an useless attempt unless the cattle are permanently removed.</p>

All this hinders my own operations, and this, I am certain, the City Council does not wish.</p>
