               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>Three aboriginals, with twenty-two horses, left York, W. Australia, for the purpose of exploring the country to the east and north-east. They arrived at Hampden Plains, lat. 31°, long. 122°, on the 9th August. Here Rowe, Monger, and a native (aboriginal) proceeded northwards, the rest of the party to the south. When about fifty miles to the north of Hampden Plains, Messrs. Rowe and Monger captured some natives, and with the aid of their own native learnt the following:—</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>That five or six years previously two white men and three horses came from a N.E. direction, and camped on the banks of a very large dry lake, called by the blacks 'Nittlebin,' described as situated thirteen day's journey (supposed to be between 300 and 400 miles) further to the north-east. Here they were overtaken by a large body of blacks who had been tracking them for some days. The horses were first seen by the natives, who tried to spear them, but were prevented by the return to camp of the two white men. One of them fired up in the air, the next fired and killed two blacks, upon which the rest made off, but returned after dark, speared one of the men as he was engaged making a damper, and next his companion. At daybreak they killed the horses and ate them, and also the bodies of the two blacks that were shot. The white men's bodies they did not mutilate through fear, but buried them after stripping them, in a small hollow scraped in the sand, and covered them with bushes. The white men had 'big and little' guns with them, saddlery, no blue blankets such as Rowe and Monger had, but things of the same shape made of kangaroo-skins. Remains of these various things are now in possession of the murderers.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>The natives who gave this information offered to conduct the party to the scene of the murders. One in particular showed great confidence in the party — following them about like a dog when he found they treated him with kindness only. This man expressed quite a desire to get a horse, and be their guide to the spot; and told R. and M. that if they returned in the wet season, he would come to them and bring his uncle, who possessed great influence with the Nittlebin blacks, to guide them to the graves of the white men.</p>
