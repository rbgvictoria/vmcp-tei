               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>On the return of Mr Babbage I was honoured with the call to elucidate the plants gathered during his journey and on these a memoir of 21 folio pages was published by me under the authority of the Victorian Government. I had also the advantage of examining all the plants collected by Mr Stuart during his last three expeditions, having received these by the favor of the late Mr Chambers. A number of notes on these plants are ready for publication and if I could have also access to the plants of the present expedition, a rather extensive essay may be furnished on the vegetation of the tracts, traversed by the South Australian Expedition.</p>
