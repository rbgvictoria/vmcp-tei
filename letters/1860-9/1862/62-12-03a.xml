               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>The extreme dryness of the season has kept the limited number of Gardeners, which I was able to keep at the close of the year, extensively employed in saving by watering the more tender and valuable plants there from destruction. Even our cisterns being already partially empty, it entails a great amount of care and labour to attend to the conveyance of water over the extensive grounds, and it is thus with the greatest delight, that I look forward to the extension of the Yan Yean pipes to our grounds in the next season, a measure for which you have shown such friendly inclination. A double action forcepump supplies now fortunately one of the nurseries and the plantation of foreign oaks with water, the fixing of the same and the laying of the pipes having been completed this month. But as the working of the pumps involves always an expense of labour, we can only hope to do full justice to our ground, when water will be available by gravitation.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>During the past month a new gate was put up at the N.E. corner of our northern Ground and a foot path formed to the walk leading to the next halting place of the Railways. This measure was suggested by the Directors of the Melbourne Railway Company for the sake of affording still greater facility to the public for visiting the Gardens. It is my intention for the purpose of rendering the walk from the Railway station to the Yarra footbridge still more agreeable to have it planted with umbrageous trees as soon as the summer is past.</p>

The herbaria are thereby also increased, and as often facilities are experienced by the liberality of the seafaring Gentlemen effecting in these shipments I have availed myself of several occasions again during the month to send also home a number of our waterbirds, caught at the Garden lake, and for which we will reciprocally receive other water fowl from abroad.</p>
