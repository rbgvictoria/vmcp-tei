M may have believed that they had been convicts but no unambiguous evidence that they had been transported has been found. Maxwell was charged in WA in 1845 with 'burglary with intent to have consensual consummation with Mary Cownden' and was eventually charged with common assault and fined (Henderson (2011), p. 631). Despite M's stated expectation that they would not see a copy, each was on his distribution list for the first volume (M to J. McCulloch, 8 December1863). Bentham did not follow M's advice but spelled out the names of Stuart and Maxwell in full (e.g. Bentham (1863-78), vol. 1, <space unit="chars" quantity="1"/>p. 14*). When Maxwell died, M wrote a short obituary; see M to the Editor, Gardeners' Chronicle, February 1880 (in this edition as 80-02-00c).</p>

He is a Gentleman of great classical attainments, who has a scholastic establishment at Paramatta. His learning is only surpassed by his readiness to serve scientific purposes. Miss L Atkinson has collected much in the Blue Mountains &amp; is entitled also to a special mark of honor. Mr E Bowman has sent few things from Queensland. Mr Eug.

I commenced collecting in 1847 in South Australia and examined the country very extensively northward as far as Lake Torrens &amp; southward as far as Encounter Bay[;] undertook also an overland journey as early as 1848 to Rivoli Bay. These labours on the South Australian were continued on my private resources til 1852 in South Australia, when I proceeded to Melbourne. In 1853 I entered under the auspices of h. Exc. C.J. Latrobe the Services of the Vict Government. In my annual reports the lines of my journeys are given. I may take the credit to myself of having fully revealed the flora of the Australian alps, of which only some traces became known to All Cunningham from the neighbourhood of Bathurst &amp; less by Lhotzky.<note xml:id="ftn26" type="footnote" n="26">
