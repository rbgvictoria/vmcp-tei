                     xml:lang="en">When Beckler decided to return to Germany, he sought a testimonial from the Royal Society of Victoria’s Exploration Committee, that had overseen the Burke &amp; Wills expedition. At its meeting on 17 January 1862, the Committee agreed that M should draft a suitable letter for the secretary, John Macadam, to sign on its behalf. At a subsequent meeting, however, which M did not attend, this decision was rescinded. M attended the next meeting and forcefully expressed his dissent from the Committee’s decision. In the meantime, however, as M states in this letter, Beckler had sailed for Europe without waiting for the Committee’s testimonial. He left Melbourne on 20 January aboard <seg style="font-style: italic; ">Yorkshire</seg>, bound for London (<seg style="font-style: italic; ">Argus</seg>, 21 January 1862, p. 4).</p>

               </note> I wondered that he asked at all for a certificate as I do not see what earthly use it can be to him particularly as I fully expect, that the Commission will speak in favorable terms of his services. I for one am convinced, that he did more than hundred others in his place could &amp; would have done. Why are you becoming such a perfect stranger to the garden?</p>
