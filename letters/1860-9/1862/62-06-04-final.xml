                     <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>Apropos of the stand being made by the professional gardeners in and about Melbourne against the practice of gratuitous supplies of plants from the Botanical Gardens in Melbourne, we may mention that Dr <seg style="">Mueller</seg> does not always win a name for liberality in those matters. One or two applications have been lately made to that gentleman by the curator of the Ballarat Botanical Gardens, for selections of certain species of trees, but although the learned botanist has thousands of the species in question he offered a very narrow dole of each in response to the application made, so narrow indeed as to seem niggardly from such a stock to such a place as Ballarat. It may be, however, that Dr <seg style="">Mueller</seg> has been a little disturbed from his usual propriety, or what the professionals may call impropriety in these matters by the late agitation got up, and not without some show of reason, by the horticulturists already mentioned. Indeed, we believe that cause was assigned, though somewhat illogically perhaps, as a reason for only giving a few where a larger number of specimens were asked for. If it were right to do a little wrong, the Committee of the Ballarat Botanical Gardens would easily pardon Dr <seg style="">Mueller</seg> if in this case he had done a greater wrong of the sort in question. </p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>I candidly admit, that I am parsimonious with the distribution of some species of select pines, because I desire them to be kept together by thousands in one of the adjoining reserves, for obtaining in future large quantities of seeds from them for forest culture. I was not aware, that the requirements of the Ballarat botan. garden had not been fully responded to, but on the contrary learn from Mr Heyne, that all that was desired &amp; available had been supplied. If however the arrangements of the Ballarat Garden Committee render it desirable, that still some select rare pines should be added to those already received, I shall feel particular happiness to supply 50 Deodars &amp; 50 other select pines, in this as an exceptional instance, although a general supply at this ratio, would within a few days exhaust the stock of these plants.</p>
