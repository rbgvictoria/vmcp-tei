While doing so, he ‘frequently referred to various books, maps, and charts, including Mr. Gregory’s original map’. The chairman, Frederick McCoy, ‘expressed a hope that Dr. Mueller would get together his memoranda on this subject, in the form of a paper, which, being read before the Royal Society, might be incorporated in its Transactions.’ M 'wished to excuse himself, as at this season of the year his hands were full of work, and the statement he had made would, no doubt, appear in the newspapers'—as, indeed, it did. He eventually agreed to comply with the request but appears never actually to have done so.</p>
