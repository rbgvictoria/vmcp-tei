               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>In the reserve between the garden and the City bridge the trenching for the reception of a double row of good sized Elms has been proceeded with, and it is my intention to make now the commencement of planting pines along the slope facing the Yarra River. The whole slope between the Garden and the City bridge will probably afford space for 40 000 of these noble trees, and we may anticipate, that the total effect of a pine forest on these slopes, in which the majestic forms of the Deodars, Wellingtonias and Stonepines prevail, must finally be grand when viewed from the City.</p>

Although these cuttings have somewhat suffered during the voyage, we hope that the majority will grow and that these very many new and celebrated kinds of vines will be gained for Victorian vineyards. His Excellency Sir Will. Denison presented a case with epiphytal Orchids gathered in the Madras presidency and has promised to introduce the Cinchona trees into our country.<note xml:id="ftn2" type="footnote" n="2">
