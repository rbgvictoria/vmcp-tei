               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>The wet weather towards the end of the winter rendered it necessary to drain part of the Class ground as well as of the Experimental Ground; but this operation could only in part be effected with drainpipes, as no means were available to obtain the necessary quantity for the whole ground. The rows of brick pits, which were added to the western propagating house have been completed. The Central wooden shade, which has stood now about 12 years and which was built of perishable material in a rustic style required new posts, the old ones being so decayed as to render a stay under the building unsafe, I had this work effected with the labor and material available at the establishment, without placing the department of public works under expenses for the purpose. Some new shelter places were also erected at the propagating places for the reception of plants, when first removed from the pits. The Capeweed, which threatens to overwhelm all other vegetation has been cut in such portions of the reserve, from where it was most likely to invade the Garden. But it was out of the question to try to subdue it elsewhere and next season I propose to have the reserve depastured during the spring months by a flock of sheep, the young trees being then probably strong enough as not to be likely injured by this measure.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>The borders have been dug throughout the ground, an operation involving much work considering the extensive area under cultivation. The new western lawn walk is under progress of being formed, altho' the work goes on only slowly as usually one man only can be employed for the purpose and much rock has to be blasted for the purpose of giving it the proper width. Some lines of wires have been drawn along the railings of the Yarra foot bridge, as a protection against accidents to unguarded children. The supplies for distributions from our nurseries during the coming year have been renewed, and a fine stock of valuable plants will be therefore again available for public institutions. A number of labels have been painted. The palm-house received a coat of paint all inside.</p>

If the Yan Yean pipes could be extended to our grounds much labor would be saved and also many trees, which now only linger away during the drier season might be brought to a much more rapid and healthful growth.</p>

All the herbariums, required for Mr Bentham in the final elaboration of the 1. vol of the universal Australian flora have now been transmitted and part of it is already on its return way. Of the magnitude of our collections we have a striking example in the fact, that not less than 144 large fascicles have been transmitted for the elaboration of only the first volume of this work, our collections being probably larger than the total of the Australian collections deposited since Sir Jos Banks time at Kew.
