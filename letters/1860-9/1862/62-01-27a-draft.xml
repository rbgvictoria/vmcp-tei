Since the glass cases provided for them are not sufficient to protect the whole of the gyps casts, I would strongly recommend that some additional cases may be made in London for securing the whole collection against dust &amp; mutilation. And here I might suggest, that for the proper keep, off-dusting &amp; cleaning of the articles and their labels an ampler provision should be made in London, than in Melbourne, where not few of the articles suffered and showed to disadvantage in consequence of the want of regular and efficient arrangements in these respects. It may be found necessary to have new labels printed for oils, resins, gums &amp; many other articles, so as to secure uniformity.</p>

Mr Bosisto, to whom I pointed out the facility of distilling these oils on a large scale, wherever sawmills exist, calculates that the Gallon of some kinds could be procured at a cost of less than 6/ (six shillings!) If so, — as I have no doubt, — I cannot but anticipate, that ere long a great commerce will spring up in this article, since the material for it is available in boundless quantity. As lightening material, for varnished and medicinal purposes, also for dissolving india rubber for waterproof liquids &amp;c &amp;c these oils will prove highly useful as will be seen by the jurors reports.
