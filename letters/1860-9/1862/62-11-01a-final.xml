               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>I have the honor of submitting a succinct progress-report on the labors performed in this establishment during the past month. The whole ground has received the necessary attention required at the spring season and exhibits a very pleasing aspect. The mowing of the lawns is already partially carried out, and this work together with the ordinary calls on our labor leaves now, when the garden personal is far reduced, no means of effecting new improvements. These however will be initiated, whenever the funds for the coming year will be available. The formation of the new western walk is meanwhile considerably progressed, the Palm house part of the zoological enclosures &amp;c received a coat of painting and a good deal of labor was devoted for the purpose of subdueing the <name key="Cryptostemma">Cryptostemma</name> (that intrusive South African weed) by cutting it and preventing thereby as far as possible its seeding. It is my intention to admit next spring a flock of sheep into the reserve adjoining the garden, where the weed is so plentyful, by which means the plant will probably be kept under; such arrangement could this season not be entered into, since the trees raised or planted in the reserve are yet too small to be exposed to the flocks.</p>
