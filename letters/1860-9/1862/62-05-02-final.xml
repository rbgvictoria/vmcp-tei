                     xml:lang="en">On April 29 1862, J. Service gave notice of these questions directed to the Chief Secretary. He formally asked the questions on 2 May 1862, the inquiry being prompted by M's having dismissed Peter Waters who had worked in the Garden for eight years. O'Shanassy replied that 'Dr Mueller had the power and had always exercised it; and there was no doubt that a gentleman having charge of the Botanic Gardens, and the duties connected with it, was the best judge as to how the work should be carried out, and ought to have full control over the servants'. He added that M had discussed the matter with him before acting, and that he 'fully concurred with Dr Mueller in his reasons for discharging him' (<seg style="font-style: italic; ">Victorian Hansard</seg>, Session 1861-1862, vol. viii, pp. 973, 1020).</p>

Consequently whenever the services of any of these employées are no further needed, or whenever decrease of fund renders the discontinuance of any of these employées necessary, or whenever any other circumstances arise for the displacement of any of the men, it has been always clearly understood as well by the employer as the employed that the engagement of the latter is only weekly and that consequently only a week's notice will be given, when their services are to be dispensed with.</p>

Of this evidence I am not allowed to make direct public use, but at the time it appeared to my honorable Chief perfectly satisfactory for my adopting the steps, which I took on the occasion.</p>
