                        <space unit="chars" quantity="1"/>mark was LL. The brace of doctors who have arrived at a contrary conclusion, may reasonably enquire, how we obtained our information. Our reply is that we got it where <seg style="font-style: italic; ">they</seg> should have looked for it, in the testimony of a competent authority—a fellow explorer of <seg style="font-variant: small-caps; ">Leichhardt's</seg>—Mr <seg style="font-variant: small-caps; ">Bunce</seg>, curator of the Botanical Gardens, Geelong, a gentleman not unknown to Dr Mueller. </p>

               </note> that no marks of Leichhardtian camps could be genuine, unless characterised by both the initials of his name. With such an assumption we could no longer recognise the trees marked L, on and about Cooper's Creek, as indications of Leichhardt's presence, and, therefore, would be called upon to give a new interpretation to the vestiges of the traveller who left so conspicuously and unequivocally the traces of his camps in those localities at a time when Leichhardt alone was in the field. Whatever may have been the intentions of Leichhardt for marking the camps of his third expedition, he indicated them, as far as evidence has hitherto led us, by a single L.

               </note> to imitate the marks of Leichhardt's camp, it would not be supposed that this is anything but quite an exceptional fact, inasmuch as such imitations have occurred as yet on no other tracks of explorers; and even if the L marks noticed by Mr M'Intyre (and which this gentleman not for a moment considers the work of natives), were imitations by the aborigines, it is but rational to anticipate the existence of original marks of Leichhardt in the vicinity. Deeply, however, it is to be regretted that, whilst no efforts should be spared to throw light on the fate of the long-forsaken travellers, and whilst every possible measure should be adopted to free Australia of the just accusation of a long neglect towards them, that in so unconcerned a manner the very evidence of his movements, however well established, should be disputed, and that instead of aiding in poor Leichhardt's cause a line of action should be adopted out of which no possible benefit can arise to the forlorn explorers, and possibly, by shaking public confidence, an incalculable harm.</p>
