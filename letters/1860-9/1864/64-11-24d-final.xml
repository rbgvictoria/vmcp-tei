I feel sorry to learn that Mr Burrows had not been more successful with his plants and I would never for a moment thought to entrust them to his care could I have foreseen they should have been lost by frost.

There are about 12 plants here in cultivation, mostly natives of Victoria, which would make charming pot-plants, and these I should have been glad Kew to possess &amp; to diffuse abroad permanently. As regards ferns I am so sorry having burdened on you what has proved an onerous task, for nothing could have been further from my intention. It merely appeared to me a very great pity, that you, my dear Sir William, should not have the advantage of the perusal of my collections for your synopsis,<note xml:id="ftn4" type="footnote" n="4">

               </note> you have often given a solitary station of a fern of one or the other of the Australian colonies whereas they are in some instances distributed widely over the country. Perhaps cautiously you were reluctant to trust to mere notes on the distribution of plants &amp; hence I thought it best to send the whole collection, imagining that as the species are well known you would at least in the majority of cases deal with them at sight. If notes were sufficient, I am under the impression that my manuscripts deposited at Kew would have furnished many additional indications of stations. So I can truely say, that my sole object in sending the ferns was to serve your work, which ought on this point to be as complete as possible.<note xml:id="ftn6" type="footnote" n="6">
