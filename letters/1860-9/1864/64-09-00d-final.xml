               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>[Some correspondence was also read by Mr Douglass between himself and Dr Mueller and Mr Sprigg, asking the former for birds, and the latter for a donation in aid of the erection of the proposed aviary. To both of these letters negative answers were returned. Dr Mueller, however, said that the present being the breeding season, he could not supply the birds except at a risk of injuring the prospects of the season; and Mr Sprigg said that though the central Society would not feel justified in voting an amount in aid of the erection of an aviary, he would be glad to supply them with some birds in due course.]</p>
