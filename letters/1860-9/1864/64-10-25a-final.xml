Packed as they were in a retentive wet soil without any drainage, how could they survive a three month voyage? Had your gardener placed these roots in a mixture of sandy soil and moss or into some other material admitting of perculation and had he placed the box slightly raised into a shallow other one (which might have been tarred inside) the plant would doubtless by a sprinkling of water being daily applied to them have reached us here in a growing state. As it is they came absolutely decayed.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>Recently a Commission was appointed by Government to report on the timber of indigenous trees for ship building. It was mortifying to me to confess to the Gentlemen, that I had never heard a word of [an]y results of investigations instituted with our timber in England, not even received the jurors report of the Exhibition on either this or any other contribution sent by my Department. Pray let me know, whether really the woods were never in England subjected to any examination; if not it will be incumbent on me to follow up the researches here locally, altho' of course with very much less facilities than are enjoyed at home for such a purpose.<note xml:id="ftn2" type="footnote" n="2">

                     xml:lang="en">M had in fact been asked if he had a copy of the jurors' report on the native timbers exhibited at the Victorian exhibition, 1861, before they were sent to London for the 1862 International Exhibition there; see J. Moore to R. Barry, 30 September 1864 (VPRS 5486/PO/2, official inward correspondence, VA925 Melbourne Public Library, Public Record Office, Victoria). He perhaps misunderstood the query because he was aware (and assumed that others would also have known) that the Victorian report (Coates, Osborne and Ashley (1862)) did not include any systematic analyses of the timber exhibits. Knowing that a very extended study had been undertaken by Francis Fowke RE of the colonial timbers sent to the 1855 London exhibition, he no doubt expected that a similar study would be undertaken in 1862, and took it that he was being asked about this. Fowke did undertake such a study, but the results were not published until 1867; see Fowke (1867). A brief, positive report of the Australian timbers exhibited was published earlier in International Exhibition, London 1862 (1862a?), p. 197, although the Victorian collection was omitted there but dealt with on p. 114.</p>

Gunn did not accept the arguments that M had intended to refute Darwin's account of speciation (M to R. Gunn, 6 January 1865), while Hance, when responding to the defence of Darwinism in J. Hooker (1869) and struggling to reconcile that position with his hope that 'there is a life beyond this world', wrote that he fancied that 'many scientific, &amp; I presume candid, men feel as I do. Ferd: Mueller sent me a copy of his little book on the Chatham Islands, with the characteristic inscription that it was "opposed to a doctrine antagonistic to Christian faith".' (H. Hance to J. Hooker, 20 February 1869 (RBG Kew, Directors' correspondence, vol.150, ff. 504-5). The 'wretched book, by a graduate, which was epitomized in Seemann's Journal, apparently as a masterpiece of anti-Darwinian argument', mentioned in the next paragraph of Hance's letter, does not refer to the notice of B64.10.02 in vol. 3, p. 9.</p>
