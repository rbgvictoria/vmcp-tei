As I have received no assistance whatever for a long time past for improvements in the Governments House reserve, not having even a single labourer allowed by Mr Hodgkinson at that spot, whilst other reserves have been very largely supported, Mr Hodgkinson will feel that it would be unjust towards the department of the botanic Garden if any of its property was parted with without an equivalent, especially as other reserves enjoy also the advantage of obtaining considerable contributions of plants raised at the botanic Garden not without considerable outlay of labor. I avail myself of this opportunity to urge on Mr Hodgkinson's favorable consideration the necessity of permitting out of the general fencing vote an adequate sum during 1864 to be devoted for the renewal of the fences at Gov House reserve along St Kilda road, this fence having stood now nearly 20 years &amp; being absolutely decaying.'</p>
