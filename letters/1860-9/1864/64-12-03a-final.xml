M's letter is followed by: ‘Those who know the properties of the eucalypti or other resiniferous trees of Queensland, might find their account in experimenting upon their yield of one at least of the articles so much desiderated. There is undoubtedly a wide margin for profit if the produce could be made available for export; and, possibly, the beneficial nature of the operation might be enhanced by combining with the manufacture of resin that of potash. Mr. <seg style="font-variant: small-caps; ">Walter Hill</seg> could, perhaps, throw some light on the subject.’</p>

               <seg style="">Sir,— In compliance with your request, I have the honor to inform you, for information of the Hon. the Commissioner of Trade and Customs, that within the district of Riverina and the colony of Victoria no pine trees exist allied to those from which the main supply of resin and wood tar imported into Britain is obtained, our only coniferous trees consisting of the Murray pine and an allied species of callitris, none of sufficient abundance for obtaining from them export supplies of pine tar. Nevertheless, I would beg to direct attention to the circumstance, that our eucalypti are yielding more or less of a peculiar kind of tar, in some instances as much as seven per cent of the weight of the dry wood, irrespective of the quantity retained in the wood vinegar; and, although this tar is not precisely identical with the ordinary wood tar of coniferous trees now generally in use, it may be anticipated that it could be advantageously substituted for many purposes for which now Stockholm tar is employed. Likewise, most other woods than those of fir-trees are producing, by dry distillation tar; but it appears that these are generally, in the northern countries, not available in sufficient abundance for the purpose. Though the per centage of eucalyptus tar may not always prove large, the process of obtaining it may, nevertheless, prove lucrative, when we consider how inexhaustible a supply of wood is available in our ranges, whilst in Europe, North Asia, and North America only the roots and branches of firs can generally be spared for the preparation of tar. Resin, similar to flr-resin, can, however, not be obtained from the eucalypti or any other Victorian trees. Of the British territories in which firs attainable for supplies of tar and resin are abundant as forest trees, Canada and the other parts of British North America, as well as the Indian highland are standing prominently. Finally, I may mention that very many thousands of plants of the Scotch fir, the tree which mainly furnishes in Europe and Northern Asia the tar and resin of commerce, have been distributed from the nurseries of the Botanic gardens of Melbourne; and it may be deserving of the consideration of the Government, whether not finally the forest culture of this and other important trees should be effected on the waste lands of the Crown.</seg>
