To accomplish their design, they had watched the party from the very moment of their arrival in the country of these tribes, had sent messengers ahead to arouse the neighbouring hordes of natives, had gradually closed upon them without Leichhardt and his companions having been seemingly aware of the impending danger, had finally and unobservedly surrounded them in large numbers, and in the dawn of morning, when the travellers were asleep, crept stealthily on the camp in the bend of a creek, threw a volley of spears on the previously ascertained positions of the sleepers, and killed all except one, who, resting a slight distance apart, had sprung up, fired one shot, and killed a native, but was then immediately speared. The oxen, horses, and mules, it is said, were then killed, the latter not without a desperate struggle to break their hobbles; but the native related, that two of the bullocks succeeded in breaking their hobbles, and that these were the only animals which escaped the slaughter. The savages perpetrating this destruction were beyond the intercourse of white men, and when plundering the camp left the tobacco and flour, then unknown to them, scattered on the ground, but displayed a particular eagerness to possess themselves of the bright red blankets, known to have been provided by Leichhardt for his party.</p>

The two stockmen then determined to return, and Mr. Lang was reluctantly obliged to relinquish his search, being, like Walker, greatly reduced in strength by extreme hardships undergone immediately before they set out on this journey, although they calculated to be able to reach the place of Leichhardt's supposed fall in ten days from the Maranoa.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>The evidence thus gained left unfortunately hardly any doubt that the poor explorers had all lost their lives by a brutal and treacherous attack of the natives, although a series of circumstances, which are best learnt from Mr. Hely's report, prevented that gentleman from reaching the locality where the death-scene took place, and although he found the accounts of the blacks as regards the precise spot of the catastrophe to be greatly at variance. It is easily understood why the natives, whilst without hesitation they generally admitted the destruction of the party, and brought to bear an undeniable amount of corroborative and circumstantial evidence on the facts, were naturally reluctant to lead the friends of the fallen men to a place where the contemplation of the spot of horror, and of the relics of the unfortunate victims, might so easily arouse in the white men feeling of the most intense indignation and of fervent vengeance. Hence Mr. Hely was readily enabled to find two of Dr. Leichhardt's camps at the sources of the Warrego and Nive, bearing as marks XVA in the lower portion of a capital L, but was constantly deceived by the blacks in their statements about the spot of the massacre. Had the guides acted otherwise, they would indeed have exposed themselves, and this without protection, to the retaliation of those tribes whom they had, may it be with ever so much justice, accused; thus the natives, ever eager to gain rewards from the travelling party, conducted it to Sir Thomas Mitchell's depôt, and other spots, and finally vanished secretly. The inscription on each of the two Leichhardtian camps found by Mr. Hely has never yet been satisfactorily deciphered, and although, by the subsequent discovery of two other trees during Gregory's and Walker's expeditions, indicating camps of Leichhardt about 80 and 87 miles further to the north-west, the interpretation of these marks became of less importance, and<space unit="chars" quantity="1"/>although no interpretation is likely to shed any light on his fate, there is still attached a melancholy interest to these, as some of the very last signs we have of his movements.

In this conclusion the committee has subsequently been strengthened by the testimony kindly proffered by Mr. Gideon Lang, who, after a lengthened conversation with several natives in 1851, calculated the distance of the spot where the tragical occurrence took place still to be ten of<space unit="chars" quantity="1"/>

We would therefore recommend that the localities on Cooper's Creek, which bear the last indisputable marks of Leichhardt's movements should again be examined, and that a party sufficiently strong to resist any attempted attacks should scrupulously, through reliable interpreters, interrogate the natives, to set the question finally at rest, whether Leichhardt and his brave little band met their death on the spot originally recorded, and if this should be affirmed, to secure such relics of the perished travellers as will place the fact of their annihilation beyond doubt.

If, however, and let us cherish the hope, the destruction of the poor explorers on that spot can be disproved, we ought not to rest until, by successive and systematic inquiry amongst the native tribes, we learn what became of the lost men, should it involve a sacrifice ever so great; for whenever Leichhardt's fall beyond the Maranoa should be disproved, the assumption that he and his faithful followers number with the dead could likewise no longer be vindicated on any tangible ground, and we could no longer dispute the possibility of any of the unhappy men still having lingered on from one tedious year to the other for relief, and to have lingered in vain. The improbability of such a fact is great indeed, but its absolute impossibility, from evidence hitherto extant, cannot be demonstrated, and future ages will then pass on Leichhardt's contemporaries their judgement. Those on whom the burden of exploration has fallen heaviest amongst us have earned almost throughout but poor rewards for their self-sacrificing labours.
