I was not aware at the time, when this communication was made to the Home Government, that it was coupled with the request of the hitherto incurred transit expenses being refunded. Having spontaneously made the offer to defray these, this point would under no circumstances have been one of hinderance. As it is, perhaps it will be best, that the whole arrangement henceforth should be a strictly official one, since you were (and very properly too) obliged to seek the aid of the Home Government in this matter, which had Prof McCoy not broken his word would have been amicably &amp; privately arranged. The Museum here stands under the Chief Secretary's political administration &amp; as this Minister (Mr M'Culloch) declared in the House of Parliament<note xml:id="ftn1" type="footnote" n="1">

The receiving agents had delivered it to Frederick McCoy at the Museum but he did not report its arrival. When the government took possession of the large meteorite in January 1865 in order to ship it to London, McCoy mounted an unsuccessful final attempt to prevent its removal. He wrote to the Chief Commissioner of Police:</p>

They stated that they had a verbal order from the Storekeeper to ship it on board the ship "Red Rover" to sail on Monday, but although they insisted on taking it away they promised not to ship it until an order was brought to me from the Chief Secretary authorising me to give up the specimen &amp; stating which of the two Meteorites was to be removed. For the protection of the public property in my charge I desire the assistance of the Police to ensure the non-shipment until the matter be investigated. (F. McCoy to F.

Should my personal and private aid become any further necessary I assure you I shall regard it a point of honor to render it. You have, my very dear Sir, no reason to thank me for what little I have done on this occasion to promote the interest of an institution of which your nation may well be proud. Contrary I blame myself now, that I did not take possession of the specimen for you in spite of the moral claims on it by our Museum, and could I have foreseen such an extraordinary course of events as happened I should have done so. I must confess a little less generosity and a little more legal keenness would be a great improvement in my character. — I intended to have written at greater length; but have been harrassed by many additional duties of late, leaving me not many sparemoments at the departure of the mail.</p>
