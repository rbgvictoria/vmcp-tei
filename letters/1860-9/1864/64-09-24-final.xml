               </note> I am aware, that we cannot absolutely guard against mishaps whilst goods are entrusted to long seavoyages, but it appears to me that in the instance out of which such serious loss arose nothing whatever was done by those to whom the packing &amp; shipping of the plants was entrusted to secure for them more safety than any ordinary good. Had I not been more painstaking you would have probably received many of my sendings in an equally spoiled state. The person entrusted with the soldering of the case ought to have taken a new lid for the box, whereby not more than 2 or 3 shillings extra expense would have been incurred; and had your shipping agent pointed out (as I <seg style="">

As the Kew resources are so enormous compared with those of my small department and as the obligation was entered into of defraying the return freight in London, perhaps you would kindly remind the shipping agent on the subject. My vote for incidental expenses is only £120 per annum, out of which the most varied accounts have to be paid for the horticultural as well as scientific branch of my establishment, any untoward charges to this vote cause embarrasment.</p>
