Heales in response to a letter he had received from the Board of Land and Works on 12 February 1864: 'I regret exceedingly that Dr Mueller should have thought it necessary to make the Report therein referred to; As the Doctor is fully aware of my anxiety not only to preserve the Shrubs and Trees, but to improve the appearance of the locality in question which I have evinced on many occasions, and by erecting at considerable expense a large number of guards to Shrubs and Trees, by a large amount of fencing), as well as road making &amp;c &amp;c. And further that when the <seg style="">

                     </seg> to fence that part of the ground: but the late gales having so injured our Buildings, it became necessary to take the Carpenters away in order to secure these. In the mean time, <seg style="">

                     </seg>, one during the day and one all the night, have been employed in looking after the Cows to prevent damage to Trees &amp;c, and I may add, I believe have done their duty, as not one Tree or Shrub, that I can discover, has been injured.'</p>
