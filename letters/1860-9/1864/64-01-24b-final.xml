                     xml:lang="en">The anonymous reviewer [Daniel Oliver?] pointed out that preparing the Flora of Australia required access to collections made since the European discovery of Australia and held in British and European museums. He commented ‘Of these and other drawbacks, Dr Mueller was fully sensible, and acting up to his convictions, he unhesitatingly withdrew all claims to the authorship of a work, for which he had made extensive preparations, and to the publication of which he had long looked forward as the height of his ambition … he earnestly recommended the acceptance of [Bentham’s] offer … and further proposed that £100 of the Colonial grant annually made to him for his own publications … be transferred … and made arrangements to transmit the whole of his magnificent Herbarium by installments to Kew, to aid in the preparation of the work, for which he has uninterruptedly continued to labour with as much zeal as if it were his own’ ([Oliver] (1863), pp. 500-1).</p>
