                     </seg> iron fencing I very much regret that Dr Mueller has made some objection to the removal of this small extent of fencing which has stood so long in the centre of a Reserve under the control of the Board of Land and Works, to another Reserve also under the control of that Body. I trust Dr Mueller will kindly reconsider the matter, as the Goldfish now thriving so well in the large pond in Fitzroy Garden so <seg style="">

                     </seg>. I will gladly give to Dr Mueller in lieu of the small quantity of fencing on the South Yarra Hill an equal quantity of iron fencing of a more open and ornamental description, also a set of dolphins and shells in artificial stone for a fountain in the Botanical Gardens'. </p>

                     <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>M replied on the same day: 'Though the iron fences, such as Mr Hodgkinson desires may be ordered at any time in Melbourne, where from scrap-iron the greater part of [the <seg style="font-weight: bold; ">is there more here?</seg>] that erected at the botanic Garden and on the <seg style="">

As I have received no assistance whatever for a long time past for improvements in the Governments House reserve, not having even a single labourer allowed by Mr Hodgkinson at that spot, whilst other reserves have been very largely supported, Mr Hodgkinson will feel that it would be unjust towards the department of the botanic Garden if any of its property was parted with without an equivalent, especially as other reserves enjoy also the advantage of obtaining considerable contributions of plants raised at the botanic Garden not without considerable outlay of labor. I avail myself of this opportunity to urge on Mr Hodgkinson's favorable consideration the necessity of permitting out of the general fencing vote an adequate sum during 1864 to be devoted for the renewal of the fences at Gov House reserve along St Kilda road, this fence having stood now nearly 20 years &amp; being absolutely decaying.'</p>

                     <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>Hodgkinson added on 7 March: 'I will gladly replace the existing fencing at the rotunda in the Govt House Reserve by iron hurdles forming when put up a <seg style="">

                     </seg>. It will be erected under the Crown Land Bailiffs supervision by labourers attached to the dept of Lands &amp; Survey. As soon as I have a set of shells and dolphins cast I will give them to the Botanical Gardens. I am now getting moulds made from the original models — There is no vote under the control of the Dept of Lands &amp; Survey that can be applied to the removal of the fence of the Govt House Reserve as the application of the very small vote at the disposal of the dept is restricted to <seg style="">

                     </seg>. Dr Mueller has been misinformed as to the age of the existing fence, which was erected in 1853 but has however decayed with great rapidity.' M concluded on 9 March: 'The exchange of the fences having been now finally arranged it remains only for me to express my best thanks for the handsome offer of Mr Hodgkinson of supplying the ornamentation of a future fountain at the bot Gardens.'</p>
