               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>My last letters you must have thought &amp; indeed most of mine very poor productions of the pen of a literary man. But whilst I assure you that I notwithstanding the want of fullness of expression in my letters cherish the most friendly feelings for you, I feel often so prostrated both in body &amp; mind after toilsome work, that I find it difficult to render my thoughts elastic &amp; expressive. I may instance that I had last week one day (at the mail day) 50 letters foreign &amp; colonial, &amp; indeed I see no prospects amidst the turmoils of departmental work to bring up literary arrears unless I abandon to a very great extent my attendance at the various meetings &amp; hence it is likely that I shall little share in the executive labours of the Acclimation Council for the remainder of the year. I declined the Presidency of the R.S.<note xml:id="ftn1" type="footnote" n="1">
