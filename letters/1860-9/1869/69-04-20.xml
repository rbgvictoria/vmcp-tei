               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>When passing to day along the southern side of the Yarra, dear Mr Fitzgibbon, I saw to my utter dismay, that one of the boatbuilders keeps an <seg style="">
                  <hi rend="underline">ass</hi>
               </seg> on his premises, and ventured to tether it out on the Yarra-bank! I at once went to him and expressed my extreme dissatisfaction at such a gross act of impropriety, when he assured me that the animal should at once be removed. Since I learn, that he has by two of my employées been previously warned, to take the creature away, and thus I feel myself not longer bound to pass the matter with a mere reprimand, but must crave of you, that you will kindly issue at once instruction for the <seg style="">
                  <hi rend="underline">immediate removal of the animal from the premises</hi>
               </seg> he occupies. If this is not done, the brute will most likely be only kept from view and at night be brought out to the plantation. A man who takes it upon himself to bring an animal of the kind mentioned into public recreation ground, is deserving of having his licence cancelled, and I feel convinced that unless these encroachments are nibbed in the bud, it will be hopeless to protect and improve the Yarra plantation. In my opinion the occupation of <seg style="">
                  <hi rend="underline">any</hi>
               </seg> public grounds ought to be coupled with the express condition, that no domestic animals of <seg style="">
                  <hi rend="underline">any</hi>
               </seg> kind should be kept. This is a good opportunity to bring also under your notice, that the man at the Bathing House after the removal of his goats some time ago brought again goats &amp; I believe it the case also with the woman Mitchell, who sells the refreshments in the park. You perhaps will scarcely credit it, when I say, that the bid of fencing required at the rear of the premises of one of the boatbuilders <seg style="">
                  <hi rend="underline">has not</hi>
               </seg> yet been erected, and that trees planted for the ornamentation of the ground near the steps down from Princes Bridge have thus gone to destruction! I trust you will support me in suppressing such a spirit of indifference, audacity and disobedience as manifested in the acts just related.</p>
