Visitors &amp; picnics parties have always found me anxious to do all in my power to oblige them, but nevertheless there are some limits to the liberty of action to be granted to Cricket &amp; Football clubs, and only when I have found them interfering with other visitors, &amp; then only have I thought it my duty to stop them.</p>

On 16 September 1869, Lissignol wrote to FitzGibbon: 'Your letter of the 6th inst enclosing a copy of your letter addressed to the Trustees of the Royal Park reached me only on my return from Tasmania, &amp; in answer I beg to state that I have at once called upon Dr Fd von Mueller the Hony Secretary to the Trustees asking him to call together a meeting of the said Trustees for the purpose of considering the subject of your letter of the 6th inst. I shall do myself the honor of informing you of the decision of the Trustees immediately after the meeting' (Unit 731, VPRS 3181, Public Record Office, Victoria).</p>
               </note> to what particular case he alludes, but I remember a few weeks ago requesting some young men who were playing football in close vicinity to the carriage drive to go and play on the other side of the Hill, where ground is set apart for that purpose, pointing out at the same time the many accidents which might occur to another class of visitors through their balls frightening horses, but all I could obtain from them were impertinent &amp; abusive answers, and to get them to comply with my request, I was obliged to threaten their very abusive spokesman with bringing him to the lock-up if he refused to give me his address as requested.</p>

Not having the honor of that distinguished gentleman's acquaintance I cannot state when this occured, but as a Councillor, he ought to know that there is nothing astonishing in an officer enforcing rules &amp; regulations in a public place. I received positive instructions from the Commissioner of Crown's Land to enforce the Regulations of the Park over the whole of its area until such time as the fence was removed and the portion of the Park <seg style="">
