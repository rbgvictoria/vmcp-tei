               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>I have the honor to solicit, that you will be pleased to place on the estimates or the supplementary estimates the sum of two hundred and twenty pounds Sterling (£220) to provide coals, oil and other material for the steam engine lately erected to supply the necessary water from the Yarra for the botanic Garden. I entertained a hope, that at late night hours (from 3-5 a.m.) or on rainy days, when the pressure is very great in the Yan Yean, some supply might be granted to this establishment here, in order to save as much as possible the <seg style="">
                  <hi rend="underline">cash-expenditure</hi>
               </seg> for coals &amp; labor in working the steam engine. I learn however this day, that this hope will not be realized, and as I am thus <seg style="">
                  <hi rend="underline">entirely</hi>
               </seg> thrown on the resources of the Yarra Yarra for water-supply, I find it impossible to obtain the needful supply without a special vote for working permanently the engine. Even on rainy days there is a considerable quantity of water consumed in the Conservatories and enclosed nurseries. Hence the sum indicated is not larger than required to do justice to the working of the establishment throughout the year.<note xml:id="ftn1" type="footnote" n="1">

                     xml:lang="en">On 2 February 1869 the Assistant Commissioner of Crown Lands and Survey, C. Hodgkinson, minuted: 'The Inspector General of Public Works is requested to state for the information of the Honble the Commissioner of Lands &amp; Survey his views relative to within Estimate of cost of working the engine recently erected by the Dept of Public Works in the Botanic Garden'. The Inspector General of Public Works, W. Wardell, replied on 4 February: 'If there is no wood available in the Reserve for fuel coal will have to be provided and I think £200 would be sufficient to provide Coal, oil &amp;c &amp;c for the engine assuming it worked 10 hours a day delivering 40 000 gallons in the 10 hours[.] If there is any wood at hand it would of course save the expense of the coal which amounts to about £180 out of the £200. Even if it is necessary to provide the £200 a very considerable economy has been effected by discontinuing the Yan Yean supply — to say nothing of the advantage gained by the inhabitants of the neighbourhood. For water used since June 1867 about a year &amp; a half the Botanical gardens owe this Department the sum of £320 for the payment of which the Crown Lands will be asked to provide in this years estimates and this sum is for <seg style="">
                        <hi rend="underline">half rates</hi>
                     </seg> only at which as a temporary measure the gardens were supplied'. On 18 February M responded: 'Returned with gratitude for aid &amp; the information afforded, and with a request that the document be forwarded to the treasury-department. No wood is available in the Garden for working the engine, as all old trees have been cut up for heating the conservatories &amp; forcing houses for a series of years.' M's request was forwarded to the Treasurer.</p>
