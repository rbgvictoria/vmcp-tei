               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>Herewith I have the honor of transmitting to you a preliminary list of the Museum plants, which you were so good to furnish for my department. In many instances it requires yet an analytic dissection of the plants, to determine exactly their specific position, but as the species are all known, (as far as I can see at a superficial glance) and as many of them do not carry with them special interest, it was scarcely necessary to examine each in detail at this early occasion.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>I beg however to remark, that the material does not admit in many cases of critical examination, for not only are many of the specimens obtained for my department extremely imperfect, but also the portion sent so scanty, as to involve the sacrifice of the whole material in such cases, were I to institute a dissection. Thus for instance I have only one flower-head of <name key="Fimbristylis%20Xyridis">Fimbristylis Xyridis</name> Br. and several other rarer plants.

Should such be the case I would feel indebted, if I obtained them from you even only on loan. In all probability it can be only of advantage to you, to see such plants specially submitted to examination for the benefit of the Adelaide collection.</p>

The living Orchids &amp;c are however not included in the number. The collector deserves much credit for his zeal and for the careful manner in which he prepared his plants; and it reflects much credit on Mr Goyder, to have placed him in a fair position to collect, as is evidenced by the sendings.<note xml:id="ftn2" type="footnote" n="2">

               </note> Should any more specimens arrive, I would be thankful for a share of them and especially for the most complete specimens you can spare, whereby an opportunity will be afforded me, to work up the material in time for a report, which document will doubtless be very acceptable to Mr Goyder on his return.<note xml:id="ftn3" type="footnote" n="3">

M's somewhat patronizing air and his assumption that he rather than Schomburgk should prepare the report on the botanical results of Goyder's expedition may have been the 'excentrick behaviour towards me' of which Schomburgk complained in a letter he wrote to Bentham a few days after this, in the light of which he sent unique specimens collected by Schultz to Kew rather than to M (see R. Schomburgk to G. Bentham, 16 August 1869 (in this edition as M69-08-16)).</p>
