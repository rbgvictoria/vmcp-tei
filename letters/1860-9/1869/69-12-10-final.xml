That he requested you would introduce him to the foremen of the different departments and labour parties employed in the Botanic Garden and contiguous reserves, with the view of informing them of his appointment and position in relation to them. That you declined to comply with this request until you had seen Mr McKean. Mr Ferguson further stated that you informed him by message you were going to the Lands Office that day, and would meet him there.</p>

Ferguson that notwithstanding 'any difficulties should have arisen in connection with the assumption of your duties, Mr McKean cannot approve of, or support you, in the attitude you have adopted which appears antagonistic to Dr. Mueller by whose instructions and advice you must be guided in the performance of those duties. Dr Mueller has been asked for an explanation of that part of your letter announcing his refusal to see you, and his non-compliance with the instructions conveyed to him regarding your appointment. Under the circumstances represented by you your proper course was to submit a report of the result of your visit to Dr. von Mueller and to await further direction.'
