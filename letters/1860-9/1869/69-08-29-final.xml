It was impossible for me to overcome the interposing obstacles. Our drought is not even yet broke! We have passed through many a weary month of rainless weather and the aspect of my gardens &amp; parks is absolutely desolate. How it will end unless rain falls within the next weeks, I do not know. All water for 400 acres of ground has by steam power to be forced from the Yarra-River over the ridges. Even large West Australian <name key="Banksia">Banksia</name>e have died off, altho water is supplied as far as the means allow. Rainwater tanks are empty since many months &amp; all my people here are almost exclusively employed in carting and carrying water about. How all this will end I do not know. Our pastural runs are overstocked, thus the natural herbage &amp; grasses get much diminished &amp; keep no longer the soil cool as in years passed by. Timber is ruthless cut away or destroyed by the continual bush fires and the underwood gets destroyed by the same calamities &amp; the traffic of pastoral animals. If we had not some mountain rages &amp; especially the Alps to the East of us, many tracts of country would finally become waterless during the summer.</seg>

If such search proves unsuccessful, well then at least much geographical knowledge would be gained &amp; W.A. would nobly have fulfilled its duties in the Leichhardt search like the Eastern colonies already have. I ventured to sketch out a plan of operation, such as I certainly after much field experience I should myself adopt, had it fallen to my happy lot to render myself free to take the field again. I suggested that a few oxen should be slaughtered at the last station &amp; the boneless meat be dried in the air to be carried thus light in weight on packhorses. On the homeway the party might use the horses for food, as we did in Gregory's expedition, and proved that it could well be done. A surveyor or even a good bushman would suffice as leader especially if 2 or 3 natives are got as guides. If to the prisoners a promise was made, as in Sir Th Mitchells expeditions, that by good manful behaviour they should gain their liberty, they would exert themselfes to the utmost. I would warn </seg>

               <seg style=""> would do all that is necessary on a trip as that proposed. Scientific men can follow on the path of these pioneers. It is my firm opinion, that the work ought to be commenced early in May or even before, if possible. The party ought indeed to be at the outskirts of the settlements at the end of the hot season. Then all the cool weather is before them and long rides without water become not so distressing &amp; discouraging to men &amp; animals. </seg>

Thus the 2 or 3 going out reconnoitering can move with ease &amp; perfect safety, especially if a supply is here and there carried to fall back on. It would have been still better, if a few Camels could have been got as I repeatedly suggested years ago. But with proper tin vessels &amp; a man understanding the simple process of soldering in the case of leakage the want of Camels will not be felt so severely as it otherwise would be.
