                     <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>Representatives of several societies and the City of Melbourne Corporation first met the Minister on Thursday 4 February 1869 to discuss a dispute about the future of the 'North Grounds' of the Botanic Garden — that is, the area north of the River Yarra that had been added to the Garden to house animals, in the period when M was responsible for the zoo. The administration of this area had now been transferred to the Friendly Societies. M was also present at this meeting (<seg style="font-style: italic; ">Argus</seg>, 5 February 1869, pp. 5-6). The meeting on 2 July 1869 that provoked M to write as reported here mainly concerned the question of trustees to be appointed to control the land; M was not present. M is responding to a statement that 'the<seg style=""> deputation</seg>, before retiring, mentioned that Dr. Mueller had removed one of the small fences inside the reserve, and that he was also taking away some of the plants, upon which Mr. Grant said he would issue instructions that nothing belonging to the reserve should be touched' (<seg style="font-style: italic; ">Argus</seg>, 3 July 1869, p. 5).</p>
               </note> as having been taken away from the North Botanical reserve, were plants raised at the expense of the Botanic-garden, and were required for aiding in the supply of churches, schools, and cemeteries, and for other public purposes, during last autumn. With respect to the iron fence alleged to have been removed from the reserve, we are informed that it was no longer required there, as it had been merely put up at the time when animals were kept on the ground, to mark off a special enclosure for some birds, &amp;c. It was removed to complete some fencing on the southern ground, and was also the property of the Botanic-garden. The friendly societies will be able to obtain a supply of plants, like other public institutions, next autumn.] </p>
