               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>Since you evidently have a desire to distinguish yourself in botanical science, dear Mr Guilfoyle, I have been reflecting, how I could aid you, and it occurred to me, that you might render <seg style="">
                  <hi rend="underline">great</hi>
               </seg> services and gain simultaneously much solid information, if you occasionally made a journey to the <seg style="">
                  <hi rend="underline">southern</hi>
               </seg> parts of New South Wales for which purpose the many steamers coachlines afford now such great facilities. You are perhaps not at all aware, that the extent of each species over the country is as yet not even determined as regards the Botany Bay plants, many of which we know as yet only from that locality, or perhaps the range of these species only northward has been determined. From the Victorian side my researches extend not farther than the vicinity of Twofold Bay. Hence the whole country <seg style="">
                  <hi rend="underline">between Illawarra and Twofold Bay</hi>
               </seg> needs search. In my works I always conscientiously quote the name of the collector along with the locality; hence your name would soon be known in botanical science if you searched any of the country indicated. If you collected <seg style="">
                  <hi rend="underline">any</hi>
               </seg> species there, I would gladly name them always at once, if you would make up a <seg style="">
                  <hi rend="underline">numbered duplicate set</hi>
               </seg> for the Museum of my Garden. You would thus obtain authentic material, which for future independent studies would be of <seg style="">
                  <hi rend="underline">immense</hi>
               </seg> value to you. In your itineration you would moreover be able to collect many a magnificent plant, for your fathers garden. Eucalypti, mosses, indeed <seg style="">
                  <hi rend="underline">any</hi>
               </seg> thing should be gathered, every plant if possible in flower &amp; <seg style="">
                  <hi rend="underline">fruit</hi>
               </seg>. Such plants would soon initiate you in the vegetation of Sydney &amp; if in your trips you could induce any <seg style="">
                  <hi rend="underline">settler</hi>
               </seg> in the south to collect, all the better. It is superfluous to tell you, that even at this season the late fruiting plants can be obtained; indeed there is something to be done here at all seasons. A few notes on the hight of the plants, on the bark of the trees, color and odor of flowers &amp;c &amp;c &amp;c would enhance the value of the collection very much.</p>
