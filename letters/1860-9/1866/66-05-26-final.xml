               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>During his stay in Melbourne I was informed by Baron Cederström, one of the Chamberlains of her Majesty the Queen of Sweden, that the King was very desirous to obtain a greenstone battle axe for his collection of arms. I have endeavoured to obtain this, but entirely failed, and know of no other means of realizing his Majestys wish than by appealing to you. Should you be pleased to spare a specimen for the King, perhaps you would send it direct to the Swedish Ambassador in London. Being myself educated in Scandinavia &amp; connected with a number of scientific friends of the Baron, I was very anxious to fulfill his wish or see it fulfilled. Several other requirements from N. Z were rendered known to me, but these I was able to get secured without troubling your Excellency for your powerful mediation. Allow me to remark, that a very intelligent &amp; zealous person is employed in the Gov. Printing Office of Wellington, a Mr W. Kelleway. I fancy, from his ready &amp; liberal transmission of seeds &amp;c to my establishment,<seg rend="FootnoteReference" style="font-size: 8pt; ">
