               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>It is with deep sorrow that I must inform you, how disheartening &amp; disastrous the intelligence is, which arrives from Carpentaria. Mr Clement Ives, who accompanied Dr White to the Gulf with a view of offering his services to the Expedition, died of malignant remittent fever, which seems to range widely over the country. Indeed I have recently learnt, that the fever spread southward as far as New South Wales. The party is directed to advance to the south west as far as their means admit to do so with safety. This will bring them far away from the fever regions, though it must be remembered that all the upland country towards the upper parts of the Gulf rivers is dry and arid; hence the party ought to be on the Gulf Rivers away from the jungles quite safe.</p>
