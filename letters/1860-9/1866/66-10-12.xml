               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>The waters of the recent flood having now sufficiently subsided for ascertaining the effect, which this inundation had on the botanic Garden, I deem it but right to render you acquainted with the precise extent of the damage sustained. About one twelfth part of the soil of the new dike formed between the Yarra &amp; Lake has slipped or been washed away and a small proportion of the young trees planted there and in the teatree swamp have been washed away by the current. The stream carried off also some of the tall fern-trees, but not many, likewise the steps at the landing place. The current overthrew also the iron fence at Andersons street, part of which is damaged, and washed away the greater part of the three rails fence on the northern reserve. Some plants destroyed by the inundation in the lower part of the garden will have to be replaced and the inundated walks will have to undergo repair.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>Had the flood happened a few months later the lake embankment would have been secure. At present the young turf of perennial English grass was not strong enough to resist the inroads of the water and the new soil, not yet exposed to any summer heat had not sufficiently hardened. Unfortunately the water rose also with such rapidity, that the existing sluice could not have kept the lagoon at an equal niveau with the river and hence it becomes now imperative to establish a wide permanent channel with a large floodgate. It would be also desirable to raise the whole river walk from Andersons Street to the western entrance of the garden by two or three feet, leaving the embankment towards the lake terraced below. I intend for additional security of the embankment to plant it closely with Willows and over it on the most exposed places with Luzern. To remove the sediment &amp; debris from the plants which stood under water, will alone take up a considerable amount of labor, the area of garden thus in a dismal state being very extensive.</p>
