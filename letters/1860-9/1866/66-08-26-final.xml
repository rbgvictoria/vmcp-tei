               </note> I have received again several sheets of proof, for which I am most grateful, and with which I am delighted. On the Eucalypti you have certainly bestowed much care and the arrangement for herbarium work is admirable. The identifications such as E. marginata, E. melliodora &amp;c are very interesting. On the pages sent I forward a few notes. As the Yorkshire is likely to arrive by the beginning of October in London you will have the rest of the <name key="Compositae">Compositae</name> in time for additions to your manuscripts. But supposed the vessel should not make a good passage, it can assuredly be of no consequence, if the printing of the book is resumed a month earlier or later, a matter which entirely depends on you and not on the publisher. If the latter received not considerable subsidies, he might make exacting terms, but as it is he ought certainly to be guided by your wishes. My own idea was all along that the Australian work &amp; that on the genera would appear simultaneously &amp; if so I could have a fair opportunity to bring my share of discoveries out amidst very many much more urgent and pressing engagements devolving on me. If however the work is hurried ahead of the genera I shall, with the little sparetime I have, be placed in future at great disadvantage, especially in years of much unexpected extrawork in the Department as during the two last. I have however done much formerly among the <name key="Coralliforae">Coralliforae</name>, e.g. <name key="Stylideae">Stylideae</name>, <name key="Goodeniaceae">Goodeniaceae</name>, Epacrideae, so that I hope to be not again in arrear. I must however attend also to my health; we are not bringing all frames alike robust into the world, and it would be a pity to see many like poor Harvey pass through overwork prematurely to the grave. On the other hand, I am certain you cannot wish, that a man, who spent 20 years of the best of his life for the elucidation of the Australian flora, should give nearly all his advantages up, dearly purchased, even to one so illustrious as you, who however, as never having seen Australia, has on its flora pardon me saying so no higher claim than on that of any other country. Kindly remember that the issue of an Australian flora was a main object for many years in my plan of life.<note xml:id="ftn7" type="footnote" n="7">

Office would probably not be allowed for the sake of economy. In Australia there seems as yet no call whatever for the work. There is and never was yet a single copy in any of the many large book shops of Victoria.
