                     xml:lang="en">On 24 March 1866 FitzGibbon wrote to the Chief Commissioner of Police, F. Standish, informing him that M had complained about shooting in the Richmond paddock and barking dogs depleting the numbers of water fowl in the Botanic Gardens. FitzGibbon asked Standish to direct the police occupying the old station buildings near the river, or any constables on duty, 'to arrest any person using fire arms there [in the park] or interfering with the birds, or the property of the public'.</p>

                     <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>Standish referred FitzGibbon's letter on 26 March 1868 to Francis Hare who reported on 27 March: 'There is no shooting carried on near the "old station buildings" but I frequently hear shots in the paddock near the Richmond road (punt road) perhaps the Chief Commissioner would request Thomas Lyttleton to direct the Constables on duty on this locality to keep a watch about dusk every evening, &amp; at day-break in the morning &amp; they will have but little difficulty in arresting persons offending against this law'. On 27 March Lyttleton commented: 'I have attended to this, &amp; directed Sgt Robinson to place a man in plain clothes to watch for persons firing' (Unit 5, VPRS 1199, PROV, for a copy see No. 750/3/66, unit 11, p. 638, VPRS 4025/P, PROV).</p>
