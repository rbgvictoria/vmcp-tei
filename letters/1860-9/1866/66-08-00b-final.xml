The ladies have decided that the movements of the expedition shall be limited to the Carpentaria country for the remainder of the two years which, according to the first stipulations, were to be devoted to the search. Within this period light will probably be thrown on the circumstances under which cause the existence of people of another race among the Gulf tribes. A surgeon is to accompany the search party. The ladies will testify their respect for the memory of the brave man who led the party sent out by them in raising on his sacred resting place a monument through their private exertions.</p>
