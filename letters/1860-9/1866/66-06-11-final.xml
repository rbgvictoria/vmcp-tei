I was also told that he had a large Medicine Chest fully furnished but that in consequence of all Labels being written in latin he was unable to make any use of the Medicines. On hearing this I started for Gilliat Creek, bringing with me some Medicines and Medical comforts that I thought might be of use, but unhappily I learned on my arrival at the Expedition Camp that he had died on the previous Monday and was shown his grave on the east bank of a large lagoon. Learning that his brother was then absent I took down the following statements</p>

M'Leod, Thos: M'Laughlin, self and two blacks. Here we camped that night and remained nine days leaving this Camp on the 30th of May.

On the 21st Mr<seg style="font-size: 10pt; "> </seg>M'Intyre intended leaving this party with the exception of one black boy, to proceed to the Camp on Gilliat Creek where the other portion of the Expedition party was camped his object being to effect a junction of the entire party and make a final start onward. Previous to the above Mr<seg style="font-size: 10pt; "> </seg>M'Intyre had visited Burke Town, and on one occasion stated that he had "thought once while in port that he had caught fever, but that he had shaken it off." On the morning of the 21st<seg style="font-size: 10pt; "> </seg>of May Mr M'Intyre complained of a slight illness, and deferred his start from the Dugald until the next day, when he was still unwell and unable to start; the sickness complained of being weakness and inclination to vomit. On Wednesday morning feeling rather better, he started accompanied by a black boy. By a letter from him dated 26 May I learned that he had reached the Gilliat on the 24th in a very exhausted state. Having arrived at the Gilliat on the night of the 5th<seg style="font-size: 10pt; "> </seg>of June I learned that Mr M'Intyre had been dead since the previous morning. He was interred on the morning of the 6th of June.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>I George Gracey, Bushman in the employment of Mr Donald M'Intyre, do hereby state that Mr Duncan M'Intyre on or about Thursday, 23rd of May about 8 Oclock a.m. accompanied by a black boy arrived here, Gilliat Creek. On his arrival he looked ill, and said he was ill, and that he had been so the night before. He soon after went to bed. At intervals he got up and went about. On the next day (Friday) he became worse, and continued to suffer more towards evening when he recovered a little. On Saturday he seemed much better and started some of his party to join those at the Dugald. On Monday he became very bad until he died. He seemed to suffer from some pain in the region of the heart. The Medicines principally used by him were salts and quinine. He was not attended by any Medical man. His brother Donald M'Intyre attended on him during the whole of his sickness. He got his brother to write out some documents. A Will might be one. At this time he had his senses. On Tuesday morning 29th May, he became insensible and continued so until Saturday night with slight intermissions. On Sunday 3rd June, he again seemed to lose his reason and became delirious. There was no sign of recovery till his death. On Monday 4th June he died 58 minutes after 5 a. m. His brother was present when he died. He was interred on Wednesday morning at 9 O clock in a grave prepared for him near the scene of his sickness; the burial service being read over him by Mr Sloman, in accordance with a wish expressed by him during his illness. He was enshrouded in some blankets. A fence is now being prepared to enclose his last resting place.</p>
