In addition to your excellent remarks on the value of this plant, let me observe that, imported by the Spaniards at the conquest of America, they transplanted it to Peru and Chili, where it now forms in its fruit a staple food for cattle. During the few years of my directorship of the Botanical Garden, I distributed the plant annually, the approximate of the number of Carob plants given away for public grounds in various parts of Victoria approaching to about 1000. If care has been bestowed on the young (pot grown) plants, this useful tree must now be established in many parts of Victoria. After distributing again about 100 plants during May of this year, I have still about as many left for hedging purposes, for which the plant is most exquisitely adapted. Besides several large plants, many years old, to be seen in various parts of the ground, one row of the Carob-bush exists in the experimental ground, at the garden lake. It should he remembered that the ceratonia is of slow growth, like the equally useful Argan tree; and though both have flowered in our ground, as yet no fruit has been obtained. Our seed merchants, gentlemen of great intelligence, and to whom the country owes much, will have for years rendered the seed by importation in such quantity available for pastoral purposes as to turn the plant practically to account. On the copious introduction of the Cork oak, to which you refer, I have bestowed much care for a series of years past; and though the acorns lose their vitality, like the generality of imported seeds, readily in transmission, even if the short line of the P. and O. S. N. Company</seg>

Most of these again became distributed, besides a considerable number of cork plants distributed by the Acclimatisation Society. At this moment about 1000 young cork-oaks are in the nurseries of the Botanical Garden; several hundred are established in the adjoining domain, where there is actually an avenue of cork trees; and in the rich collection of foreign oaks possessed by the garden one tree is now 11ft, high, and likely soon to yield cork. Were I not afraid to occupy too much space of your journal, I would claim the favor of allowing by special reference that the Botanical Garden has been conscious of its duty to import largely and render known generally other plants of climatic zones analogous to ours I am, Sir, with friendly regards, yours, </seg>
