               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>On the afternoon before the opening of the Exhibition, no measures were yet adopted for the arrangement of the articles sent from Brisbane; indeed the majority of the articles were not even unpacked. The steamer of the morning had brought no representative from your colony, and hence it was evident that the measures for placing the articles, and labelling them, &amp;c., would devolve on the Commissioners. I brought the facts before the Organisation Committee (of which I am not a member), and was asked to undertake the arrangement and other work connected with your Court, — a call to which I the more gladly responded, as the Northern Exhibition Committee of your colony had asked me, through Mr. Thozet, to attend to their interest. Moreover, having travelled through Queensland, I am, perhaps, to some extent able to give personal explanation on most of the exhibits. Though suffering from a severe attack of bronchitis, contracted at the building a few days before, while engaged in general work of the Commission, or in my Court of vegetable productions, I finished the Queensland Court in time, but have yet for many days to attend to the labelling of the articles, which will forthwith have my attention.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>In looking through the correspondence from Queensland, I notice by a letter dated 11th September, and written by your Secretary, that ten cases had then been dispatched, and that a list of contents were forwarded simultaneously, and others were to follow. One list must be either at the Office still, or with the gentlemen who compiled the catalogue, and it will be only to-day that I can try to get it, because really I had not a moment to spare before. I would have had leisure some days ago, but unfortunately a tremendous flood devastated the lower part of the garden in the beginning of this month, and thus I was entirely thrown out of my calculations for division of work. You and the other contributors towards the exhibition, and the Commissioners, may rest assured that nothing on my part shall be left undone to bring, during the progress of the Exhibition, the excellence of the very many important articles sent from your colony prominently before the public, and especially before those best able to judge. I should feel indebted if I could learn how much of the cotton is to be sent out of each little bale to Paris, and would like also to have a list of all the articles exclusively intended for Paris, as the labels show this only in a few instances. The shipment in the goods will have to be effected about the middle of next month, and meanwhile the articles can have the benefit of exhibition here. Being a member of a special committee to look after the exhibits from Victoria for Paris, I will give gladly at the same time your articles intended for France my best attention. Mr. Fairfax, a gentleman from Queensland, who lately returned to Victoria, takes a great interest in all you send, and has kindly offered aid and information within his reach. If you have not yet sent a list of your timber, corresponding to the numbers pray let me have it, and if you have any instructions pray do not hesitate letting me know your wishes. Trusting that I have thus far aided your interests.</p>

                     xml:lang="en">Hill forwarded M's letter to the <seg style="font-style: italic; ">Queensland daily guardian</seg> where it was published along with the following comments by Hill: 'I wish to state, in reference to this letter, that the different sorts of woods of this colony were sent down to Melbourne, <seg style="font-style: italic; ">numbered</seg>, and that a written catalogue of the names of the woods, as classified by the Botanist, and as designated by those who use them for practical purposes, was also sent:— the labelled numbers on the wood corresponding with their similar number on the catalogue, and being an index thereto. From the contents of Dr. Mueller's letter, I should imagine that this catalogue had never reached its destination; but I am informed by the Secretary to the Commissioners for the Exhibition here (Mr. Lyons), that since the receipt of my letter he has received a telegraphic message, to the effect, "catalogue found," and it is presumed that this is my catalogue in connection with the woods of the colony. I ardently desired that the catalogue should be printed instead of being sent in manuscript, but it was found that this request was not to be complied with. I may mention that Dr. Mueller only acknowledges in the subjoined letter the receipt of ten cases of exhibits; there is another lot of twelve cases which were shipped a week or a fortnight after these ten cases which I presume at the date of Dr. Mueller's letter had not come under his cognizance. These twelve cases, if exhibited, would make an essential difference in the display of Queensland, as it was, according to the last accounts; and as it would be were the contents of those cases to be in the department allotted to this colony. They contain many of the most valuable specimens of timber, also tanning and medicinal barks, and also fibres, together with coffee, arrowroot, and other productions, which are either indigenous to this colony, or which, imported, can be grown in this colony alone amongst the Australian groups'.</p>
