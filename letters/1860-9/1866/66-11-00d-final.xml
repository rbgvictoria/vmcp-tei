Comparing trees uninjured, he assumes that about 30ft. have to be added as a fair estimate to length of the tree before it dropped, giving thus the stupendous height of about 420ft. for this colossal species, while 450ft. is the greatest and exceptional height on record of the Californian <name key="Wellingtonia">Wellingtonia</name>.

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>It would be interesting if measurements were made by residents in various parts of Australia of the particular kinds of trees of their neighbourhood, of whatever kinds such trees may be, in order that they may be recorded before the trees themselves sink under the axe of the woodcutter, and finally become annihilated. Where the trees, as in most parts of Victoria, are gregarious, no fear of their annihilation exists, but where, as throughout nearly the whole of the littoral tract of East Australia, the forest consists of a miscellaneous mass of trees, the rarer kinds are certain to be obliterated in time from the face of the globe, and the most stately individuals of each kind are generally certain to sink first. It needs no remark that all such measurements should be <seg style="font-style: italic; ">actual</seg> ones.

This is, as regards the eucalyptus, all the more needed now, as they have been found to yield remuneratively so many highly valuable articles for industry, such as fibre for paper, tar, spirit, acetic and tannic acid, dye material, oil (both from leaves and bark), and other substances calculated to add to the riches of the country, and especially to the prosperity of the working classes, for lengthened periods. </p>
