It is dated to late October 1866, as the latest likely date that it could have been written by M to be reported in this issue of the newspaper, published weekly. On the basis of the note in B61.13.12, p. 157, where Th. H. Hulke, of New Plymouth is said to have supplied M with a living specimen from which M named <seg style="font-style: italic; ">Veronica hulkeana</seg>,, the correspondent would seem to be that person. However, no biographical details of Th. H. Hulke have been found, whereas William King Hulke had established what became a very successful nursery for producing New Zealand flax at New Plymouth in the early 1860s. He had no children (<seg style="font-style: italic; ">Taranaki daily news</seg>
                     <seg style="">, 24 October 1908, p. 2). The only other Hulke in the New Zealand electoral rolls is Charles Hulke, but he was never recorded as living in the Taranaki district, in which New Plymouth is situated. M acknowledges receiving plants from W. H. Hulke in M to W. Nicholson, 12 January 1860. </seg>
