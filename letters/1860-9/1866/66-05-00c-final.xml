                     xml:lang="en">The mystery surrounding the fate of the unfortunate Leichardt seems to be rapidly extending itself to the expedition sent in search of him. The circumstances connected with the dismemberment of the party at Cooper's Creek have never been satisfactorily explained—they are still mysterious; and <space unit="chars" quantity="1"/>now the whereabouts of Mr. M'Intyre and his <space unit="chars" quantity="1"/>little band is becoming involved in mystery. Under these circumstances Dr. Mueller thinks, and so it seems do the Ladies' Committee, that the subscribers to the fund and the public should reserve judgment on the case of Dr. Murray, the late second in command, until fuller information is before them. The following is a letter on the subject, which we have received from Dr. Mueller: </p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>In the total absence of all despatches from the leader of the expedition sent by the ladies for ascertaining Leichardt’s fate, I must ask, through your esteemed journal, the promoters of the enterprise to withhold, until the close of the expedition, their judgment on the occurrences which led to the dismemberment of the original party after the retreat from Cooper’s Creek. I feel convinced that Mr. M’Intyre will feel sorrow and regret when he hears of the deep injury which he has unknowingly done to the gentleman who with so much distinction served in Howitt’s expedition.<note xml:id="ftn2" type="footnote" n="2">

There had been discussion in the press concerning the alleged failures of Murray leading to the loss of the horses of the expedition, and reports of McIntryre's comments on 'the futile efforts of Dr Murray to attempt to throw the blame of his own cowardice and indiscretion on Mr M'Intyre' (see, for example, <seg style="font-style: italic; ">Age</seg>, 1 May 1866, p. 5).</p>
               </note> The Ladies’ Committee is prevented from placing official records of the disasters sustained by the party before the public, no despatches (as remarked) whatever having been received — a circumstance which only can be explained by the possibility of the loss of such documents on the way to their destination. In response to various questions in public journals, suffice it for the present to repeat that a legal document fixes the scope, the extent of time, and the proportionate expenditure of the expedition, and demands as well the periodical transmission of reports on its progress and results.</p>
