The text given here is from <seg style="font-style: italic; ">Gardeners' chronicle and agricultural gazette</seg>, 3 November 1866, p. 1045 (B66.11.01, 66.11.02 and B66.11.03, published as a single item of 'Foreign Correspondence' but individually indexed by the journal). It is dated to August as the latest likely date that it could have been written to have been published on 3 November. This date is consistent with the content of the letter. A full report of the contributions to the International Horticultural and Botanical Congress, London, 23-4 May 1866, was printed in the <seg style="font-style: italic; ">Gardeners' chronicle and agricultural gazette</seg> of 26 May, continued on 2 June; the latter included lists of the papers presented, in some cases with abstracts, including M's on cinchona (B66.06.01). An extract from the issue of May 26 was printed in the <seg style="font-style: italic; ">Australasian</seg>, 28 July 1866, p. 538, so M would have seen around the beginning of August that his suggestions on a European flora were not presented. It is possible that M's reaction to the editor's comment on his note on the hardiness of Australian ferns (see n. 4) was sent earlier and held over, but <seg style="">it is more probable that the items were extracted from the same letter as separately indexed articles</seg>.</p>

               </note> But remark how far south in New Zealand Fern trees grow; and in our Alps I have seen them in sheltered valleys at a height of 4500 feet.
