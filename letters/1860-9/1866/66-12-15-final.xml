               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>It is my pleasing task to announce the discovery of a memorable bird belonging to the small group of Strathioniae, hitherto, with exception of extinct species, only represented by the ostrich of Africa and South-west Asia, the cassowary of India, the mooruk of New Britain, the nandu and the Darwinian rhea of South America, the emu of our continent, the two kiwi-kiwis of New Zealand. The new member added to this interesting series of birds consists in nothing less than a casoar or cassowary from North-east Australia, equally distinct from the typical species (Casuarius galeatus, Vieillot) which has such an extensive distribution over the Indian Archipelago and the Malayan Peninsula, and from the mooruk (Casuarius Bennettii, Gould) of the Admiralty Islands, which but a few years ago, through my friend Dr. George Bennett,<note xml:id="ftn2" type="footnote" n="2">

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>For the intelligence of the existence of an Australian true casoar, and for the means of defining preliminarily its specific characters, I am indebted to G. Randall Johnson, Esq., who in September last, while on a visit to Rockingham Bay, shot in the Gowrie Creek scrub the only specimen of this remarkable bird as yet obtained, and whose name I wish it should bear; and I cannot do better than to give in the first instance publicity to the lucid remarks transmitted to me by that gentleman:—</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>The specimen shot is a male bird, and closely resembles the helmeted cassowary, but is of smaller size, its greatest height when standing in a natural position being not more than four feet and a half. The head and neck are almost entirely bare of feathers, and the skin of different shades of blue and red. On the top of the head is a horny substance of dirty light-brown colour, the beak is black, the irides of rich light-brown; the skin from the beak along the top of the head, and extending five inches down the back of the neck, marine blue; below this, still following the back of the neck down to the point at which the feathers become thick, a length of five inches, the skin is of a cinnabar-red tint; the underside of the head and throat, from the beak downward, being of ultramarine, and the small triangular portion immediately adjoining the feathers of indigo blue, and fluted or puffed, as it were in ridges. At the bottom of the throat are two pendent caruncles of a bright red colour, very similar to those of the common turkeycock, and four inches in length.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>The leg, from the knee-joint downwards, measured twelve inches, and is very stout and powerful, whilst two of the toes of each foot are five inches, and the centre one seven inches long. The inside toe is armed with a long sharp and strong nail, with which, no doubt, a serious wound might be inflicted. The feathers are of a deep black colour, and similar in shape to those of the emu; at a distance they present the appearance of coarse hairs rather than of feathers.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>The bird seems to confine itself almost entirely to the more open parts of the scrubs, and seldom ventures far out on the plains. During the months of July, August, and September its food consists chiefly of an egg-shaped blue-skinned berry, the fruit of a large tree. This, together with herbage, probably forms its diet, at least for that portion of the year, but at present its habits have been so little observed, that hardly anything is known concerning them."</p>

               </note> it is obvious that the Casuarius Johnsonii must rank as a separate species. The size of the bird may be the same as that of the Indian Casuarius galeatus; the former, however, has the neck coloured with two shades of blue, and wants the broad squalid-violet vitta, and while in the Indian cassowary the black hairy plumage commences immediately below the oblique violet band, and covers the lower portion of the neck quite along the scarlet posterior caruncle, the Australian bird shows an indigo-blue to descend in a cuneate-deltoid form to the thorax quite as deep as the two cervical anterior appendages. The short lower curved quill is not noticed by any writer on the Casuarius galeatus so far as I am aware, and seems, therefore, not to exist in that species. The caruncular appendages towards the sternum are given as pink in <seg style="font-style: italic; ">D'Orbigny's Dictionare Universal d'Histoire Naturelle</seg>, while Mr. Johnson describes them as bright red in the Australian species.<note xml:id="ftn4" type="footnote" n="4">
