               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>In accordance with your Excellencys request I beg to place before you a succinct statement on the present position of the enterprise, which under the auspices of the Ladies of Victoria is destined to unveil the fate of Dr Leichhardt's expedition.</p>
            <p rend="letter"
               style="font-family: Geneva; font-size: 12pt; "
               xml:lang="en">
               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>As justly observed by your Excellency it is incumbent upon the Administrative Committee to afford authentic information to the Home Government on all important events concerning the enterprise, more so especially since our gracious and beloved Queen has graced the Ladies' enterprise by her sublime patronage and by her generous sympathy. A record of the progress of the expedition would have been offered to your Excellency before, had not the Ladies been desirous to await the arrival of official despatches from the leader of the search party. Any such documents have however as yet not come into the possession of the Committee, because perhaps no opportunity presented itself to the leader of the expedition to forward reports from a far inland position since the disasters happened at Cooper's Creek (about which also as yet no despatches are exstant)<note xml:id="ftn2" type="footnote" n="2">
                  <p rend="Footnote"

                     <seg style="">While McIntyre was searching for water when Cooper’s Creek was found to be dry, James Murray, second-in-command of the expedition, served medicinal brandy to the men and, drunk, lost most of the expedition’s horses and much of the equipment. When McIntyre returned to the camp, he discharged Murray and the other culprits.</seg>

               </note> or perhaps the written records may be detained on their way prior to their reaching any line of postal communication.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>Your Excellency will therefore be pleased to regard this preliminary report of progress merely as a brief explanation of recent events, as far as I am able to give to them an interpretation from very imperfect data and from such impressions as force themselfes on my mind.</p>
            <p rend="letter"

               xml:lang="en">
               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>The Expedition proceeded on its course from the Darling's river to the Paroo in preference to choosing a starting point from the North East or North Coast. It would have involved expenses far exceeding the funds at the Ladies Command to provide by charter for the shipment of the Dromedaries to a distant harbour. Moreover Mr M'Intyre had horses, equipment, and stores of his former expedition available on or near the Paroo. The line of that watercourse was consequently selected by the leader himself for his first field operations after the union of the members of his party.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>The Ladies Committee exercises no ruling power on the special arrangements of the Commander of the party, but simply entered into an agreement with Mr M'Intyre to carry out the search for a limited sum during a specified period and under such obligations and restrictions as the Ladies responsibility towards the Governments of Australia and towards the subscribers seemed to demand.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>The unexampled aridity of the last two seasons prior to the rainfalls in the interior some time during january last rendered the march of the expedition from the Paroo much more embarrassed than was anticipated by the leader; and it is to be regretted, that he did not deviate to the Warrego, which river, as far as I can judge, offered all through the trying season a perfectly open and safe line of travelling for the caravane towards the north.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>In his attempt to reach Coopers Creek before the December and Januar rainfalls Mr M'Intyre while relying with too great confidence on the presense of water in the Barcoo under the 26° of S. L imperilled the safety of his party, lost all his horses (nearly 70) except three, though none of the camels, and he was thereby obliged to retreat again to a more southern position.</p>

From that stream, which long since must have been reached by the Ladies-Expedition, the real search will commence.</p>
