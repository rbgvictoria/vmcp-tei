Another case, if not already received, will arrive by the next Southern Cross. Dr. Mueller has also promised a very large supply of Fir Trees, for the new Cemetery, and he offered me, or through myself, 500 Tea Trees to any person who will take the trouble of preparing a suitable piece of ground to plant them in. Under these circumstances, I think some acknowledgement is due to Dr. Mueller more than the usual receipt for plants received.' Agnew also read a memorandum by the Superintendent of the Gardens, F. Abbott: 'With reference to Dr. Mueller's splendid donations, I think the thanks of the society are due to that gentleman for his liberality, not only on the present occasion but on many previous ones. In the present collection which consists of 185 Plants and 1,178 papers of Seeds, although there are some more of botanical interest than otherwise, there are many useful and ornamental varieties.'</p>

On all such occasions we were certain of receiving a most prompt and courteous reply.'</p>
