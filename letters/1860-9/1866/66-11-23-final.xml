Though I am aware of the enlightened interest evinced by your Excellency in the resources of this country, I should have refrained from approaching with these results formally, had not his Grace the Duke of Newcastle some years ago desired, that investigations should be made in this colony into the adaptation of any extensively available fibrous substances adapted for the manufacture of paper.<note xml:id="ftn2" type="footnote" n="2">

There can however not be the slightest doubt, I venture to affirm, that the fibres used on this occasion and many others on which I intend to report more fully, could here locally be turned to the greatest advantage for the fabrication of all the rougher kinds of papers. It has also been my aim to point out, how very many poor families might find locations of prosperity in the wide tracts of our salubrious but as yet unoccupied ranges by devoting their attention and their labour for the object of procuring the raw material so vastly available for manufactures, not merely such as those of paper, but also of tars, acetic acid, oils, dye-material and other substances constantly needed for arts and industry. In this sense I was laboring, when I prepared for the exhibition now the series of tars &amp;c of such trees as now for many thousands of squaremiles occupy perfectly uninhabited tracts of the country, and I was gratified to observe, that the results in regard to yield and quality obtained by these experiments are most encouraging, and are likley to indicate paths of prosperity for numerous inhabitants of these fine tracts of her Majestys Australian great territory. </p>

He thought it probable that 'some special notice ... will be taken in the awards of the Jurors, or in the reports of the Sub Committees' of the specimens displayed at the Intercolonial Exhibition. Other specimens were transmitted with Despatch 41 of 20 December 1866. See M to H. Manners-Sutton, 15 December 1866 (in this edition as 66-12-15a) and M to H. Manners-Sutton, 23 December 1866.</p>

                     <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>A report from the Association of Paper Manufacturers of Great Britain and Ireland, dated London 20 April 1867 and signed by John Evans FRS and Thomas Roytledge, stated that there was a great difference in the strength and commercial value between the samples. It was doubtful whether some of the vegetable products would be useful because of lack of strength and length of fibre. Others, however were well adapted to paper manufacture, namely Phormium tenax, Cyperus vaginatus, Dichelachne crinita, Stipa semibarbata, Eucalyptus obliqua, and Xanthorrhoea minor. Phormium tenax was already well known, and commanded a high price for ropemaking and spinning, which precluded its use in papermaking 'at least in this country … when clean is worth about £25 per ton' and made £35 when flax and Hemp prices were high; and for papermaking its value in the raw state would not exceed £15 per ton. Few if any of the other plants were superior to 'Esparto or Spanish Grass' and some inferior, either in strength or ease of cleaning and bleaching. Esparto sold in British Ports for £4 to £5 (never more than £6) per ton. Since all raw fibres bulk very large 'there appears no probability that any of the materials prepared by Dr Mueller (with the exception of Phormium tenax) could be imported into this country except at a loss, as the mere freight would probably amount to more than the commercial value of the fibre. Whether the manufacture of paper could be carried on in the Colony of Victoria depended on local conditions and they could therefore offer no opinion on this. In conclusion they expressed 'high approbation of the careful manner in which Dr Mueller has prepared his specimens and the skill he has evinced in the selection of the materials for them' (National Archives, London, CO 309/86, Victoria, original correspondence, Offices (part 2) and individuals, vol. 4, 1867, Victoria 4238, f. 81).</p>
