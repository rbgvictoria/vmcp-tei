               </note>To all to whom these Presents shall come I Prosper Vincent Ramel of No. 29 Rue Louis le Grand in the City of Paris, of the Empire of France, by my attorney Ferdinand Mueller Doctor in Medicine and Government Botanist, of Melbourne Victoria send greeting. Whereas I am desirous of obtaining Royal Letters Patent for securing unto me Her Majesty's special license, that I, my executors administrators and assigns and such others as I or they should at any time agree with no others should and lawfully might from time to time and at all times during the term of fourteen years (to be computed from the day on which this instrument shall be left at the Office of the Chief Secretary) make use exercise and vend within the Colony of Victoria and its dependencies an invention for a new Method of preparing the leaves and bark of plants belonging to the genus Eucalyptus and of other plants of the family of Myrtaceae for the purpose of using tham as Tobacco and Snuff, and in order to obtain the said letters patent I must by an instrument in writing under my hand and seal particularly describe and ascertain the nature of the said invention and in what manner the same is to be performed and must also enter into the covenand hereinafter contained. Now know Ye that the nature of the said invention and the manner in which the same is to be performed is particularly described and ascertained in and by the following statement. That is to say, the invention consists in the utilisation of the leaves and bark of Eucalypti and other Myrtaceous plants for all purposes for which Tobacco is now used. Plants of that Class do not contain the injurious substances which are found in the Tobaccoplant, all the constituents of the former being totally innocuous and inoffensive. The leaves of these plants are pleasant to the taste and smell after the juices they contain have been expressed and after their essential oil is evaporated. Their ashes possess neither corrosive nor astringent properities and they do not affect in any way the mucous parts of the palate or throat or the gums or enamel of the teeth. Their smoke when burnt contains no injurious vapors. The simple process required for the preparation of the leaves consists in their being dried after they have been collected. They are then submitted to a bleaching process by means of hot water or steam after which they are dried again when they are fit to undergo the usual operations required by Tobacco intented for manufacture into snuff, cigars, cake roll or other Tobacco. And I do hereby for myself my heirs executors and administrators covenant with Her Majesty, Her heirs and successors that I believe the said invention to be a new invention as to public use and exercise thereof an that I do not know or believe that any other person than myself is the true and first inventor of the said invention and that I will not deposit these present at the Office of the Chief Secretary with any such knowledge or belief as last aforesaid</p>
