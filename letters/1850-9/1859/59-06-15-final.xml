LXXV, Australian and Pacific letters 1859-65, letter no. 51). The proposal for the 'grand scheme' was submitted by Denison to the Secretary of State for the Colonies on 27 December 1858, but it was not proceeded with because of the expense.

The Colonial Office replied that the Commissioners of the Treasury <space unit="chars" quantity="1"/>'did not deem it expedient' to support a grant for the Flora of Australia that year, but that they would consider a proposal for the following year (Earl of Carnarvon to W. Hooker, 18 August 1858 (RBG Kew, Kew Gardens, Colonial floras, f. 40.)) <space unit="chars" quantity="1"/>However, when Hooker asked in February 1861 for support for a Flora modelled on Bentham's Flora of Hong Kong (Bentham (1861a), the proposal was firmly <space unit="chars" quantity="1"/>rejected, as the Commissioners of the Treasury <space unit="chars" quantity="1"/>'think that any works of the proposed description may be left to the enterprise of the Colonies themselves' (T.

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>I further coincide with his Excellency Sir Henry Barkly in the opinion, that a joint work by Mr Bentham and myself would be more complete &amp; I would venture to say more free of errors, than if the work was undertaken by our celebrated friend alone. For altho' I not for a moment consider myself in the remotest way equal to the task with Mr Bentham, I still may contend, that I enjoyed unrivalled opportunities of examining plants in a living state &amp; that I can furnish very ample material about the distribution of species. I would therefore propose, to work order after order up as far as my now magnificent material of plants extends, furnishing an english diagnosis &amp; description of species, genera &amp; orders, to which Mr Bentham probably would be inclined to add those plants in species or variety which I do not possess, add quotations, figures and correct names, identify species &amp; so forth. Mr Bentham will have no doubt a rich store of additional species to describe from Drummonds &amp; Cunninghams Collections &amp; probably even from Brown's<note xml:id="ftn5" type="footnote" n="5">

But I think it might be very well arranged, that each authors writings are distinguished by his initials, so that he may be responsible for it alone. If under such arrangements the "plants of Australia" can be published, I need not say that I shall feel proud to work with one of the most learned &amp; amiable Botanists of the age, and that I shall not fail to do the utmost, to render my own writings worthy of your &amp; his acceptance I have about 10 plates ready for the Flora of Victoria.
