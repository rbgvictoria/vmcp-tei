Some new painted Garden-labels are written. The dried specimens have been sorted and the duplicates are already partially distributed as well as the seeds, gathered last season. The Stumps of old trees have been rooted out in various portions of the Ground. The wood fence in the reserve, contracted for by Mr Hughes is not yet completed, which is so much more to be regretted as the winter season is setting in, which is likely to prove injurious to some of the animals on the low Ground where they are kept at present.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>The flat on the N. E. side of the lagoon has been cleared from dead timber and the half decayed underwood and a beautiful cool place for summer promenade will thereby be added to the Ground. The walk at the N. W. entrance of the Garden has been raised to a level at some places more than 3 feet for which purpose it was necessary to build a stonewall on the Yarra bank. To prevent any accidents of children falling from this steep wall into the river, the former has been lined with basalt-bolders, which were brought across the river from our Northern Ground.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>I understand, that the owners of the small Yarra-steamers intend to petition the Government for a landing place at this new stone wall, a measure which I can fully recommend to favorable consideration. The declivity below the lodge has been brought to an equal slope and will be planted with Furze, prickly pears and other suitable plants. In the Northern Ground the long main walk has been completed and a gate has been fixed at the W. entrance, by which means the inhabitants of E. Melbourne can readily enter the zoological Garden without deviation.</p>

The weather during the month being so dry, but little ground has as yet been prepared for planting. Still as water is available in the cistern of the palm-house, the terrace around that building has been planted already. In this edifice a fine Indian Banana is ripening now its fruits, whilst the noble Waterlily <name key="Victoria%20regia">Victoria regia</name> has been raised in one of our hotbeds. In order to provide for this magnificent plant, it is intended to build an addition to the small hot-house. The erection of a propagating house is likewise under consideration. In the Northern ground a three rail fence has been put up along the main fence for the protection of the young trees which we intend to plant there this season.</p>
