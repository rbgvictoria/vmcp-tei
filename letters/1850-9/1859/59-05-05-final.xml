The circular took the form of a letter written by the Secretary of the Society, P. Le Neve Foster, to the Under Secretary of State for the Colonies, the Earl of Carnarvon, dated 1 January 1859. In the letter Le Neve Foster outlined the measures the Council of the Society had considered the best ones for obtaining the information required. '1. That such colonies as consider that the meetings and proceedings of the Society of Arts would at all serve to give publicity to their resources, and tend to increase the demand for their productions, should select some competent person, or existing society in the colony, to frame a complete statement of the points upon which it is considered that the public of the mother-country are not sufficiently informed. | 2. That the individual or public body thus selected should at once be put in direct communication with the Society of Arts. | 3. That the person or persons thus chosen should also designate, and obtain the consent of, some well-informed person in this country, either himself to read, at an evening meeting of the Society, the paper prepared in the colony, or to confer with the Council as to the best method of securing their common objects.'
