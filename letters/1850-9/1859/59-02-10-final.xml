               </note> on the subject of St. Vincent seeds, I am obliged to state there are some difficulties, but I will do the best I can. The fact is, West Indians are for the most part utilitarians, and care little for anything except sugar. I do not know an individual in this island either skilled or interested in botany — there is not even a commonly good gardener, so far as I am aware; and when recently invited by Dr. Hooker to contribute to a new West Indian Flora, which is about to be published under the aid of the British Government, we literally were without means of doing so.</p>

There are, I have no doubt, many interesting and curious plants in this colony, for it possesses an admirable climate for the tropics, with very frequent rains. It is entirely volcanic in its formation, but possesses high ranges, deep valleys, dense forests, open plains, numerous streams, and in fact everything to lead you to expect a rich and varied vegetation. There are, however, many impediments to making researches or collections. The vines and undergrowth amongst the forests are so matted and tangled, that it is difficult to quit a beaten road or pathway cut through it, whilst the extreme heat and the frequent showers render much exposure not very safe for Europeans, besides the ordinary relaxing and enervating effect of all tropical climates, which not only indisposes to, but incapacitates for, much exertion; still, a person who could give up the time, and felt an interest in the subject, might do much. I have not seen your memo. on "Australian Exploration,"<note xml:id="ftn5" type="footnote" n="5">

               </note> to which you refer, but have no doubt it is a very interesting one; your personal knowledge, experience, and abilities must necessarily make it so. Now and then I hear of what is doing in South Australia, but generally long after the events. They seem very energetic, and to be making great exertions in exploring to the north and north west. I should like greatly to know the nature of the country inland to the N.E. of the Great Bight, about the 129th parallel of longitude; as, when passing along the coast line, I found large flights of parrots coming from that direction to feed upon berries on the coast, then flying back again to the N.E. Now, the parrot always occupies a watered and a wooded, and generally a hilly country. There is, therefore, much yet to be discovered I believe, as point after point is gained from which to take a fresh departure. I feel sure, too, that the <seg style="font-style: italic; ">natives</seg> here crossed the continent from the north to the south, for reasons given in my travels;<note xml:id="ftn6" type="footnote" n="6">

               </note> and, if they did, there must be a country supplying water and food at intervals. We shall yet, I think, see Australia traversed from north to south one of these days, and a good deal appears to have been recently and to be now doing towards accomplishing this. It would give me very great pleasure to re-visit a country in which I have spent so many years, where I have still many kind and valued friends, and where I universally experienced the greatest kindness. It has always been regarded by me in the light of a home, and if God spares my life I dare say I shall return to it again.</p>
