Dr. Thomson and Mr O'Meara seeing the unlikelihood of any business being done, soon left. His Worship and the reporter remained till twenty minutes to 4 o'clock, but no one else arrived.</p>

                     xml:lang="en">The Mayor stated that the occasion of his calling the meeting was the receipt of a letter, dated the 7th July, from Dr. Wilkie, drawing his attention to the fact, that only four weeks remained in which to make up the L2000, the collection of which would entitle the Melbourne Exploration Committee to draw the L1000, some time ago anonymously given on those terms. In answer to that letter his Worship had written to Dr Wilkie (who acts as honorary treasurer to the Melbourne committee) asking for information to lay before any meeting that he might call in the proposed behalf, and asking also that some member of the Melbourne committee might be deputed to attend such meeting and to answer any question that might be put. To that letter Dr Wilkie had replied that he had laid his Worship's letter before the exploration committee, and that no promise could be made with reference to the attendance of any member of the Melbourne committee; but that Dr. Muller would write a letter containing statements which could be read to the Geelong meeting. His Worship had yesterday morning received a letter from Dr Mueller and handed it to our representative for publication, as follows:—</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>It occurred to us that without difficulty, by the united aid of gentlemen in various parts of the colony, at least part of the yet wanting amount may be raised, and to yourself grateful acknowledgement is due for rendering so considerately your powerful support in the good cause.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>Although the sum of L3000, if at all obtained, would appear but very inadequate to the enterprise, particularly if undertaken, as it is proposed, on a more extensive plan, it must yet be remembered that many months since the Government ordered 24 camels for the proposed expedition from India. When thus provided with the principal means of transport, the party may, if we succeed to raise the above sum, be fully equipped and also provided with travelling supplies and depot stores for one season without exceeding the above amount. And should the results of the expedition during the first season be proportioned to just expectations, we may then safely trust to the liberality of our Legislators for such subsidies as will be necessary for carrying on the expedition for a series of years. The general plan of operations, which the committee recommend, will be such as is likely to insure the safety of the party, and at least a gradual if not a rapid exploration of the main portions of the unknown interior.</p>

Gregory, a depot be established on the lower part of Cooper's Creek, in about longitude 140° 30’, the explorers would then be enabled to reconnoitre from a far inland point the central parts of Australia until suitable localities, and remoter than the other are found for advancing gradually and safely the depot.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>If we further recollect that the late geographical researches of Mr. Augustus Gregory, in Tropical Australia, of Major Warburton, Mr. Babbage, and Mr. Sturt, in South Australia, and of Mr. F. A. Gregory, in the country north east of Sharks Bay, have considerably diminished the extent of unknown country between the traversed tracts, and that there seem to the final exploration of the whole interior no obstacles which under the advantage of a favorable season and under the enjoyment of those means which successes or failures in former explorations suggested, might not be overcome by experience, skill, caution, and perseverance—we may then regard the expedition proposed by the colonists of Victoria as timely formed, fully deserving the support of the country and well auguring of success.</p>

               </note> Land would probably tend to the speedy occupation of the fertile pastures of North-west Australia, and thereby to the subsequent gradual extent of civilization around our tropical coasts, wherever harbors and sea communication facilitate export. And not without importance is assuredly this consideration at a time, when the long cherished hope for telegraphic communication between Australia and the northern hemisphere, is at the verge of realisation. And should even these great results not be promoted by the proposed journey, it will still be sufficiently important to secure national interest and support for the completion of the charts of this continent, and for the elucidation of the productions of nature which, never without purpose, a bountiful providence has strewed over every part of the globe.</p>
