                     xml:lang="en">In a letter to the Editor appearing in the <seg style="font-style: italic; ">Argus</seg> on 28 January, 'G. S.' praised the introduction of English birds into Victoria but also commented: 'The food, however, appears to be one of the greatest difficulties; and it is owing probably to that cause, or some unintentional mismanagement in the quantities or qualities of it, which affects the birds in our aviary in the Botanic Gardens, where I miss many of the little warblers I formerly saw hopping about. I am ignorant whether they may have been removed elsewhere. But even the hardy canary does not seem to multiply there, nor the still hardier goldfinch. I also miss the native bear and its cub, which ought surely to have thriven, with moderate attention. It will prove to be a sad waste of trouble and expense, besides vexation, to procure animals we cannot keep when we have got them.' (<seg style="font-style: italic; ">Argus</seg>, 28 January 1859, p. 1).</p>
               </note> relative to the animals of this establishment, I feel it my duty to observe, that the limited experiment of diffusing from our aviary gradually foreign singing birds over the country has not been of so unpromising results as would appear from your correspondent's statement. The mortality amongst our singing-birds has been very inconsiderable indeed, and certainly did not arise from want of attention, the birds having been from the beginning under the care of one of the most zealous and observing <seg style="font-style: italic; ">employés</seg> of this establishment.</p>

               </note> it should be considered that we possess of some species only male birds, but of no kind more than one or two female ones. Of goldfinches, for instance, to which your informant especially alludes, we obtained the first female bird only this week. These desiderata were publicly alluded in one of the last meetings of the Philosophical Institute.</p>
