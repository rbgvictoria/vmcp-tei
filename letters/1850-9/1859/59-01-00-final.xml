Considerable quantities of seeds and specimens have been received and supplied. A person, who undertook repeatedly nocturnal walks to the garden for stealing plants was apprehended by the vigilant gatekeeper of the zoological Ground. The menagerie is yet greatly suffering from want of accommodation, which it is hoped can soon be fully aforded by the votes of 1859.

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>The latter part of the month was devoted by the Gov. Botanist for examining the vegetation of the Australian Alps towards the sources of the M'Allister River. The latter stream breaks through a mountainous country (from geological appearance) evidently auriferous; the gentle hills along it form for the greater part pasture land. Some botanical novelties were discovered and the main range of the S.W. Alps was now for the first time ascertained to extend in an almost semielliptical line from Mount Wellington to Mount Useful varying in elevation from 4000 to 5000' except in its northern part, where at the source of one of the M'Allister branches this dividing range is broken &amp; somewhat more depressed. Several high mountains were on this occasion ascended for the first time. Thus it appears, that Mount Wellington is to be regarded as the Southern Key of the Australian Alps. The meritorious and enterprising discoverer of Gipps land, Angus M'Millan Esq was my companion on this journey and generously furnished 6 horses and almost the entire outfit for it. I would gladly, if time and circumstances admit of it, prosecute yet this season researches in the newly discovered range, as it is likely that from hence on a spur of the snowy mountains Mount Baw Baw, which has never been adscended may be reached.</p>
