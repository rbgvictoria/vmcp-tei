Slander, when well and heartily done, is generally pretty harmless. I confess my first impression was to take no notice of it. On second thoughts, I resolved to contradict it in the plainest way and the fewest words. With that view I wrote the letter which I now request you to publish. I took it to the office, and finding the editor out, I called at his house and delivered it to him in person. He assured me it should be inserted to-day, and in a prominent place. Not a trace of it could I find in the issue of to-day. Having occasion to write a note to our respected president, I casually mentioned the above circumstances. In the course of the afternoon I received the letter which I now hand you for insertion. The parties responsible for the paper broke faith with both of us. The leading article in the <seg style="font-style: italic; ">Herald</seg> of yesterday entitled "What are our Philosophers Doing?" is one piece of slander upon the Philosophical Institute. It has been my fortune on several occasions to have to deny and correct statements in most of the public journals of this city, but I never met with any difficulty in so doing. My denial of a statement was always inserted with courtesy, and if the editor had been misled he said so. By inserting this letter I feel certain you will not be violating that etiquette which ought always to exist between public journals. I take on my own head all the blame. I should be a coward, indeed, if I were to shrink from discharging a public duty from fear of the Melbourne <seg style="font-style: italic; ">Herald</seg>. When a journal has openly slandered a public body of men, and asserted a thing as a fact which is no fact, it is mean to try to prevent the denial of it from appearing with the least delay. Dr. Mueller's note will tell the part he took in contradicting the article. Mine will speak my meaning pretty plainly.'</p>
