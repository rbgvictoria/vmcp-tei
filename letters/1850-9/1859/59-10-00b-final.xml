We commenced replacing the old wooden fence on the Eastern side of the Garden by iron-fencing. A tank for the growth of water plants has been furnished at the new propagating house, and the latter building is now approaching completion. The new iron-bridge at the aviary is so far ready as to be crossed by visitors. All the edgings underwent weeding and trimming. A large lot of annual seeds has been sown throughout the flowerborders, by which means a supply of ornamental herbs will be raised to keep the Garden gay during the season, whilst our nursery has been greatly enlarged for the reception of seeds of trees and shrubs for next seasons supply.</p>
