               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>The old rustic bridge at the aviary has been replaced by an new one, resting on strong iron pillars, and having an additional width of 6'; its railings are also of iron, thus likely to be lasting almost permanently. The iron-fence near the Yarra foot-bridge, to replace the old wooden fence is under progress of erection. The dike on the Yarra is almost completed. The digging of all the shrub- and flower-borders has been carried out during the month, the edgings are in part trimmed and thus the whole garden has now a neat clean appearance at the season, when the beautiful spring vegetation attracts so many visitors to our Ground. Mr Dallachy was sent for a few days to the Dandenong ranges to collect for the Gardens. Those walks in the Central portion of the Gardens, which were not yet lined with trees, have been planted with Chinese Locust trees and Powlonias.<note xml:id="ftn3" type="footnote" n="3">

               </note> The Nursery has been enlarged, an abundant stock of cuttings and seeds has been been put in, so that, unless the season should be very unfavorable there will be a very large ammount of plants available for distribution next winter. In the zoological Gardens trees have been planted along the Northern fence-line. The labelling of the plants is continuing. Bone manure has been applied to the barren parts of the Ground.</p>

Some Kangaroos and a few minor animals have been added to the Menagerie including Manilla doves. A pure Alpaca Ram is promised by the New South Wales Government for our menagerie, to be forwarded next month. A Case of living plants has been sent to the botanic Garden of Mauritius, an other to that of the Cape of good Hope, a third to New Plymouth and a fourth to Moreton Bay and a fifth for Wellington, N. Zealand, and a sixth to Hobarton. Whilst we have received besides many small contributions, 1 Case with living plants from Hon.
