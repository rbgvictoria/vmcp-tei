                     <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>Letter not found. The MS, in R. Kippist's hand, is headed 'Extract of a letter from Dr Ferd. Müller to Mr Kippist; &amp; dated "Botanic Gardens, Melbourne"'. Beneath the quoted passage Kippist has written 'The L.S. has received the first no. of the Transactions of the Philosophical Society of Victoria'. Aston (1984) dates the issue of the first part of the <seg style="font-style: italic; ">Transactions of the Philosophical Society of Victoria</seg>, vol. 1, pp. 1-33 to between 18 September and 22 November 1854. That part included M's paper B54.13.06, which he read at the first general meeting of the Society on 12 August 1854 and which was 'laid before the Meeting' of the Society on 14 November 1854 (<seg style="font-style: italic; ">Proceedings</seg>
                     <seg style="font-style: italic; ">of the Philosophical Society of Victoria, </seg>p. v), that is, just before Aston's latest date for its publication. M was not sure in early October where his account of new plants would be published (M to J. Foster, 5 October 1854), implying that this letter was written after 5 October. In M to J. Foster, 31 October 1854 M announced that he would be departing on a visit to the 'Australian alps' the next day. His return on 9 March 1855 was announced in M to W. Haines, 19 March 1855. The letter is therefore dated to October 1854 as the most plausible date for its having been sent.</p>
