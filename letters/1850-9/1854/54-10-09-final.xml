Unrestricted to time and locality I would probably be most successfull, and under all circumstances endeavour to execute my duties to the satisfaction of the government. The extent of time required for the proposed expedition might be approximately 5 months, and I deem it necessary to starte not later than towards the end of this month, in order to reach the remote mountains at that time, when the snow is dissolving, and to obtain thus their spring-vegetation.</p>

On 11 October 1854, a clerk pointed out to him tactfully: 'His Excellency may perhaps have overlooked the last page of Dr Müllers letter wherein the information requested is given —'. Hotham decided: 'The sum required may be paid during this tour but the whole subject will be carefully examined when I have more time'. He then added: 'Am I to understand Dr M. — will travel on £150 —?' It was then explained to him that M meant to travel on £150 and the wages of his attendant.</p>
