Most of them are intended for yourself; but I took also the liberty of adding a small parcel for Mr La Trobe and another for Mr Kippist. I shall be delighted to learn, that you received them with pleasure, and I am most anxiously awaiting some intelligence from the safe arrival of those, which I transmitted or rather prepared for transmission now more than a year ago. I must confess, Sir William, I feel very unhappy, that I can not put my mind at rest on this point, before I leave for the alps, which will be in a few days, thinking that you must consider me very neglectful.

However I hope, that under the guard of providence I may complete to some degree the exploration of the whole alpine chain of this continent, and after some journeys the[n] a second time (in a different season) to some other localitites again, I hope, the material will be sufficient to commence my Victoria Flora (in English.) The valuable labours of Dr. Jos. Hooker, which I shall have probably by that time before me will render me material assistance in this otherwise difficult undertaking; I say difficult, as I have no access to authentic specimens.

Hooker to C. Hotham, 15 May 1854; No. 69, unit 1, VPRS 4021 letters of introduction to the Governor, VA 466 Governor, Public Record Office, Victoria). Hooker's letter to Hotham was also a letter of recommendation for 'Mr John Anderson, who has been long our Chief gardener in the Royal Pleasure-grounds of Kew, &amp; has had the management of the Nursery &amp; all the Trees &amp; Shrubs in those extensive grounds', who was going to Victoria and to whom Hooker was entrusting a case of plants for the Melbourne Botanic Garden. </p>
               </note> Both went into the country; it lay not in my power to engage them, as the practical management of the gardens lays not in my hand. For Anderson I had procured a place in a survey party, but I believe, as such employment is not lucrative, he preferred an other offer made to him. The plants, k[indly] forwarded by them came partially well into our hands; but on emigrants vessels it is difficult to allot to them a secure place. I was delighted to see the Tea plant amongst them. The <name key="Boehmeria">Boehmeria</name> however was dead. Could we not get, Sir William, <name key="Ilex%20Paraguensis">Ilex Paraguensis</name> and other plants of utility? I will try my best to restore an aequivalent not unproportionate to what we received. From the many seeds of Argan tree only two are raised[,] sufficient however to establish this valuable tree in these colonies. The woods which I have provided for the Paris Exhibition, some of rarety, will be probably by the commissioners afterwards send to your aekonomical Museum according to my proposal<note xml:id="ftn10" type="footnote" n="10">
