The alpine vegetation is peculiarly interesting and now I am thankful to say we can look to you for a great deal of valuable information respecting the plants of this great continent of Australia.

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>I would take leave, however, to suggest something like the following plan as the best for a proposed tour for the flora of Australia proper. Your main reliance must be on dried specimens. You will by your own exertions and the exertions of others procure specimens of all the species you possibly can, and not single specimens but many, and in as many states of flower or fruit as possible. By any or all of these, especially all except the most common, or familiarly known, you will perhaps communicate specimens to me with numbers attached as responding with numbers to the same plants in your own collection. Thus we can compare them with the named plants in our great Herbarium and send you correct names and any remarks by letter. You will of course, whether the plant is young or old, make your notes of specific character, and thus you can find the correct names to your description as well as to the plant.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>It must be a long time before such notes will be read to constitute a Flora, but having new descriptions made is a step towards it, and when sufficiently full it will not be difficult to put them, in order for publication. But I do not think that Dr Hooker or anyone could pledge himself to any further aid until the time comes for the publication.</p>

               </note> I am doubtful if I have given the right name for want of good and authentic specimens from Sydney to name it with, for ours is a Sydney species. You most justly observe that, owing to brief and imperfect diagnosis not enabling us to decide from species it is immediately set down as a new one, and the science thus encumbered with many more new species than are in a genus. Mr Bentham is gone for many months to the continent and he is when at home, wholly absorbed in his vast collections. Mr Brown, now in this 80th year feels the infirmities of age upon him, and this month has retired from the Presidency of the Linnean Society on account of his inability for the duties. You desire seeds of our Australian plants with names etc. To such as we have you shall be welcome. Comparatively few however bear seed with us (though they flower very readily), for want of insects probably to fertilise them, and of hot weather to perfect the stamens and pistils. I have ordered the seeds of these plants as gathered for you and it was worth the same doing if you can send your young plants which we raise from Australian seeds. But as I said before, I think you will do best to rely upon your <seg style="">
