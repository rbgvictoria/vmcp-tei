                        <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>On 5 May 1853 the Honorary Secretary of the Botanic Gardens Committee of Management, H. Ginn, recommended, following an inspection, that the greenhouses be purchased, but La Trobe felt unable to proceed (B53/4503, unit 185, VPRS 1189, PROV). The Botanic Gardens Committee met on 26 July 1853, M being one of those in attendance, and again recommended that the greenhouses be purchased 'as it was considered they were much needed and would be a great acquisition to the Gardens' (J. Balmain to J. Foster 27 July 1853, in this edition as M53-07-27). La Trobe on this occasion sanctioned the purchase, with the proviso that the units could be disposed of again should the purchase not be approved by the Legislative Council (No. 53/128, unit 1, VPRS 3149, PROV); the purchase was subsequently confirmed despite an increase in the projected cost to the government to £800.

Balmain to J. Foster, 14 September 1853 explained the increase in cost as a provision to cover the 'expense for carting, sorting and putting the buildings in such a state that they could be left without risk of injury until funds were voted for their erection' (D53/9233, unit 185, VPRS 1189 inward registered correspondence, VA 856 Colonial Secretary's Office, Public Record Office, Victoria).</p>
