When M wrote the present letter he was about to depart on his second botanical exploration as Government Botanist, and he would have expected La Trobe to have left the colony long before he returned to Melbourne. In the event, however, La Trobe was not relieved of duty at once and was not able to sail for England until 6 May 1854. See also M to W. Hooker, 28 April 1854.</p>

In nearly all this instances I either possess or have seen a complete series of intermediate specimens or I was according to the best of my believe, entitled to my conclusions by clear analogies. In the same degree as I continue to watch the indigenous plants in their polymorphous state, in the same manner I become convinced that in all natural orders the species are multiplied far above their natural limits. Reichenbach once observed, that if a certain species of his were not acknowledged, 20 000 others must be also abolished and he has, I think, spoken the truth against his intention.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>No one can feel better than myself, how much my notes must be improved yet year after year or even before they pass through the press here and there by your masterhand; still I confidently hope, that I shall enjoy the indulgence of the botanists, as I stand here perfectly alone, without any aid, only scantily provided with books, without access to authentic specimens and even without a magnifying-glass, powerful enough to examine the anther appendices of Angianthea or the Embryon of many Pittosporae. In South Australia I was generally so little at liberty to pay attention to our favourite science, that for the sake of a general classification I was sometimes obliged to abstain from very special examinations and during the first years of my stay there I was also not aware, that your celebrated son had already described so many Tasmanian plants, which I believed to be unknown. But of all what I have written up to this time I can say truely it is my own; for I received only remarks from Dr Sonder on hardly more than a dozen of species, chiefly <name key="Compositae">Compositae</name>, having not yet received his monographia of my <name key="Compositae">Compositae</name>, which will be surely exquisite.<note xml:id="ftn13" type="footnote" n="13">
