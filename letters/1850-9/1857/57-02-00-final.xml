                     xml:lang="en">M's letter was re-read at the ordinary meeting of the Institute on 4 March 1857. At this meeting Andrew Clarke moved that Macadam be instructed to acknowledge the letter's receipt and to convey to M 'the appreciation of the Institute of his labours, and the sympathy of its members in his scientific researches, as also the expression of a hope that ere long the Institute would be favored by Dr. Mueller's presence and co-operation'. Henry Barkly seconded the motion and 'amongst other eulogistic remarks, stated that Sir Wm. Hooker of the Botanic Gardens at Kew, had expressed to His Excellency his high opinion of Dr. Mueller, in the terms "That his merits as a Botanist were only superseded by his modesty as a man."' The motion was carried by acclamation. See <seg style="font-style: italic; ">Transactions of the Philosophical Institute of Victoria</seg>
