                     xml:lang="en">Gregory submitted this letter, via the Colonial Secretary, H. Parker, for the consideration of Governor General W. Denison, on 6 January 1857: 'In recommending this arrangement to the favourable consideration of His Excellency, I would observe that it would be a matter of regret, should the Botanical specimens and memoranda, which have been collected at such expense and labor, be permitted to remain in the incomplete state which has rendered a portion of many previous collections unavailable to science.' Denison commented, 7 January 1857: 'I can have no possible objection to accede to Mr Muellers request so far as it is in my power that is he has my full permission to proceed to Melbourne to make such arrangements as may be necessary to enable him to proceed to Europe with as little delay as possible — but it must not be forgotten that Mr Mueller is an officer in the service of the Govnt of Victoria — a letter therefore must be addressed to the Col Secy of that Colony stating the object with which Mr Mueller wishes to proceed to England, and my wish that, should it be possible, leave should be granted to him for the period stated' (No. 57/95/2, 4/3351 letters received, Colonial Secretary's Department, Archives Authority of New South Wales, Sydney).</p>

Gregory to M, 10 January 1857). The Victorian Chief Secretary, W. Haines, was similarly informed by letter on 12 January 1857 (No. 522, vol. 1856-7 Z, VPRS 1186, PROV). This letter and a copy of M to Gregory, 6 January 1857 were forwarded to the Public Works Department, Melbourne (No. 445, unit 3, p. 55, VPRS 963, PROV).</p>
