Not to issue any plants or articles from the Gardens without the written order of the Director, or in his absence of the Assistant or Clerk. | No trees are on any account to be felled, either in the Gardens or the Domain, without the written authority of the Director. In case of its being necessary to fell any tree, all the wood is to be cut into billets, stacked, and disposed of by sale or otherwise, as the President of the Board of Land &amp; Works shall direct. In no case is it to be used as firewood, by any Government employé unless paid for at current rates. | Not to allow more than three head of cattle at any one time within the domain. | Horses to be admitted on the order of the Director, and paid for according to existing regulations. | The Superintendent is generally to obey such instructions as he may receive from the Director, without whose knowledge and consent he will not commence any new work.'
