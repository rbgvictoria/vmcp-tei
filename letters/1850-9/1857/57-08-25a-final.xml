               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>During the year 1856 scarcely any additional ground could be devoted to cultivation, owing principally to the limited funds available at the time for wages, and the necessary retrenchments of 1855 reduced the number of laborers for many months even to five and six.</p>

To level the walks, to bring the slopes of the culture-ground to an equal declivity, and to remove the gravel superincumbent to the sandy argillaceous subsoil, was to be accomplished on all undulating ground only by a great amount of labor.</p>

The southernmost portion of the ground is reserved partially for raising hereafter, as far as lies in our power, plants of such trees as recommend themselves for the formation of avenues along our public roads, or for plantations on Government reserves. Another portion is destined for experiments on the cultivation of those plants which may prove of economical, medicinal, or commercial importance.</p>
