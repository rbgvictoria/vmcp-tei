               </note> I have often felt that the best I can do, towards comparing your specimens before publication, correcting the proofs &amp;c &amp;c is infinitely far short of all you deserve &amp; all I would be glad to do — &amp; as it is I feel it is infinitely less than you must naturally expect, for I know that not one half or one quarter of the queries you address to us are answered; nor half the descriptions fully compared. You have no idea of the length of time such comparisons take in this country, owing to the size of our Herbaria, the number of books to consult; &amp; the variable nature of specimens; the imperfection of published descriptions, the number of already instituted bad genera &amp; species.

All this takes time, &amp; time is the measure of what we can do to help you. You will I can assure you, find that the working out your plants with this Herbarium &amp; Library is a very different &amp; far less easy thing, than you suppose, &amp; that your plants will have given to yourself, a totally different aspect here to what they have in Australia — "circumstances alter cases" — There are besides here a mass of undescribed &amp; unnamed materials that (like your lately found specimens of <seg style="">
