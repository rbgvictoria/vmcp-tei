                     <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>On 30 September 1857 J. Macadam, Honorary Secretary of the Philosophical Institute of Victoria, wrote to the Chief Secretary, W. Haines: 'That the feasibility of permanently introducing various song birds into the Colony, was lately brought forward at the Institute, in a paper read by Mr Wilson [see E. Wilson (1858)] recounting some experiments already made and which had been partially successful. — That, a subcommittee of the Institute was appointed to co-operate in the attainment of this end — That, a statement having been laid before the Committee to the effect, That, friends of this kind of experiment at home had intimated their wish to send out some birds which might probably be expected to arrive shortly. The Committee decided upon recommending to the members of the Institute the setting apart a certain sum, to meet the expenses of the experiment in this neighbourhood. — That, the Botanical Gardens were deemed a suitable locality for testing the experiment, and, that it was considered advisable to wait upon the Government and apply for their Co-operation and Assistance. — That, if the Government would supply funds for the erection of an Aviary within the Gardens, to be strictly and specially adapted for the above purpose, and to be placed under the Supervision of the Institute or its Committee, and, to meet some portion of the expense attendant upon the arrival of the Birds that may be sent, it is believed that the experiment would have a fair trial. — That, the Philosophical Institute would contribute a proportionate share, and that contributions of suitable birds would be made by many colonists who take a natural interest in such experiments. — That, the erection of an Aviary in the Botanical Gardens would add greatly to their interest with those who resort to them, and would not require more than a very moderate amount of the sum promised by you, to be devoted to such purposes, in accordance with the recommendations of a Select Committee of the Legislative Assembly.'

Pasley forwarded Macadam's letter to M on 7 October asking: 'Will Dr Müller be good enough to state in what manner this suggestion can best be carried out, and in what part of the Gardens. I think the Aviary should be rather extensive, &amp; should include both wood &amp; water.'</p>
