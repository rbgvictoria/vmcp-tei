Dr Mueller's engagement with the North Australian Expedition having thus terminated I have to assure His Excellency that throughought the period he has been attatched to it, none could have exhibited a greater desire to further the objects of the Expedition, or a more unreemitting attention to the duties of his appointment.' Denison commented: 'Mr Gregory should communicate to Dr Mueller the expression of my thanks for the zealous manner in which he has performed his duties' (No. 57/2163, 4/3358 letters received, Colonial Secretary's Department, Archives Authority of New South Wales, Sydney).</p>
