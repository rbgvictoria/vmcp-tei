               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>Desirous of communicating to you regularly by the mail, I shall forward a few lines again, and apprize you of the close of my labours in Sydney. The collections are packed, the report is written and with the diagnoses of such a number of plants accompanied, that the whole of these descriptions transmitted illustrate now nearly 600 sp. of trop. Australian plants. Probably the New part will arrive by this mail, and it would consequently superfluous to speak of the last results of my labours. I shall feel happy to learn, that my two letters from Melbourne and the three principle letters from Sydney arrived, as also the reciept of the box with specimens transmitted by Dr Elsey together with 160 bot. descriptions pr. Alnwick Castle. He took also a few lines with him for you and so does Mr Flood, who leaves within a few days. I am at the eve of my departure for Melbourne, and trust to be able to come for closing my two works either next year or in 1859 to Kew. It would indeed be equally necessary and delightful. Meanwhile I shall be able to reestablish myself fairly in Melbourne and to examine the two or three places in the Colony Victoria, where no one yet botanized. I hope to remain in favour with his excellency Sir Henry Barkly, who I deplore to say lost his Lady, and this must be felt by the Governor so much more, as the recreation in domestic live[s] now fail to alleviate the cares of his harrassed position in these political changes.<note xml:id="ftn1" type="footnote" n="1">

               </note> With regard to the wood-specimens I regret principly the loss of that of Adansonia. Professor Schleiden was anxious, I know, to examine that of <name key="Adansonia%20digitata">Adansonia digitata</name>, and I think the result of the investigation would have been, to assign to it a much shorter period of life, than is generally attributed to these trees. Indeed the wood is so soft and perishable, that the accounts of the longevity of Adansonia become quite incredible. I may quote at this occasion Mr Gregorys observation on the formation of several concentric rings in <name key="Eucalyptus">Eucalyptus</name> and <name key="Nuytsia">Nuytsia</name> annually! —, and it is well worth further observation, if really the laws of the formation of yearly distinct layers are holding good for the trees of those climates, in which no periodical cessation of growth takes place, namely in all the evergreen trees of the tropics and the warmer temperate zone and of which so many are independant of season producing leaves flowers and fruits all throughout the year. We have now in Australia good opportunity of collecting data upon this point, for of many planted trees we know their exact age, and a number of specimens of various kinds with correct note of the length of their existence should be transmitted, to throw light upon this interesting question. My own impression is, that the age of tropical trees is in general far overrated, —</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>With regard to my descriptive notes I have yet to observe, that I have worked under several disadvantages, for which you, with your usual indulgence, will make in all likelihood due allowance. One difficulty consisted therein, that I was unable to get all the specimens at once together. We were for a long time afraid that the "Messenger" was lost; not waiting upon uncertainties I had to commence with arranging the notes of the latter part of the expedition without access to the earlier onces. And when at last the vessel arrived, I had to separate all the rescued damaged specimens from those, which arrived in good order Thus time was lost and the comparison here frustrated; still I scarcely believe, that the same sp. occurs in the diagnoses on any occasion under a double name, altho' this may be the case with the specimens in a few instances.</p>
