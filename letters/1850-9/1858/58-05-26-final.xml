He imagined the amount asked for, being so very small, there would be no difficulty in getting the assistance of the Government, although he considered it would have been better had the subject been mooted before the Estimates for the present year had been made up. He also considered that the view in which the deputation had put the question, was one of so much advantage to the commercial community, that the Government<space unit="chars" quantity="1"/>would not hesitate to assist them. His Excellency then stated that, if the deputation thought that it would be of any benefit to the object, he should be most happy to communicate with Mr. Babbage, who was about to start from Adelaide on a similar expedition.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>After this interview with his Excellency Sir Henry Barkly, the Hon. Secretary transmitted a copy of the resolutions of the public meeting to the Hon. W. C. Haines, then Chief Secretary, and requested the favour of an interview on behalf of the deputation, but previous to the day appointed for receiving the deputation, Mr. Haines was unexpectedly called out of town. At the next meeting of the Exploration Committee, held on the 8th February, it was resolved that the Hon. Secretary should communicate with the Hon. the Chief Secretary, and again solicit an interview with him, in terms of the resolution of the public meeting. The deputation waited by appointment upon the Chief Secretary, who, after listening to an explanation of the objects of the deputation, pleaded the inability of the Government, at this late period of the Session, to place money on the Estimates for the proposed expedition. He thought the object not more pressing than many others, that the Government had been led into a much greater expenditure than had been contemplated, and that it would be impossible for any Government to conduct the affairs of the country if the expenditure was not limited to the ordinary revenue. He thought when the colonies were united under a federal government, that would be the best time to undertake the exploration of the interior by a combined effort. The Government, however, would be open to consider the expediency of the proposed expedition next Session, and Parliament would be in a better position to vote the necessary funds. He would place the arguments of the deputation before his colleagues, but he did not anticipate a more favourable result.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>The deputation was also favoured with an interview with the Hon. C. H. Ebden, the late Colonial Treasurer, who listened with much attention to the objects contemplated by the Philosophical Institute, and thought it very desirable that Victoria should contribute towards the exploration of the interior, but considered it a very inconvenient time to get the necessary funds. He should like to see Victoria combining with the other Australian colonies in a systematic exploration of the interior, or that she should undertake it alone if the other colonies declined. He thought it not right that the colony of Victoria should send an exploring expedition into New South Wales territory, without communicating with the New South Wales Government on the subject. He advised that the Exploration Committee should put itself in communication with Mr. Gregory, with a view to ascertain if he would be willing to undertake the command of a Victorian expedition, and promised that the Government would give the most favourable consideration to a proposal of this kind next Session of Parliament, and that, personally, he would give it his warmest support; indeed, he thought he might say that there would be no difficulty in their carrying out the object.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>Your committee has to express great disappointment at the result of their interview with the late Chief Secretary. The proposal that Victoria should take part in exploring the vast central regions of Australia had met with an unanimous response from the public, and had everywhere been warmly supported by the press, and your committee, therefore, had always entertained the hope that, by the liberality of Parliament, they would be enabled to despatch a small party to the Lower Darling, so as to be in time to start from Mount Murchison on the first approach of the winter rains, in April or May of the present year. Your Committee has only to regret the failure of its just expectations, and they feel that this disappointment of their hopes has been largely shared by all classes in the community.</p>
