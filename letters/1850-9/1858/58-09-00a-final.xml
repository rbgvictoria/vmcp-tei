Thus we have not only to a great extent subdued the weeds, but also promoted the decomposition of the stiff and compact clay-soil, and conveyed the moisture of this season to the deeper strata of the ground. A large lot of soil was carted from the slope opposite the menagerie to the new walk formed along the lagoon. The basaltic soil from the Yarra-banks has been conveyed to the young trees in the Pinetum, which is now nearly completed. All the Blue Gum trees for the avenues laid out between the city and the botanic Garden, under Dr. Mueller's direction, have been supplied, and it is hoped, that this new work will be one of lasting advantage. The honorable the Chief Commissioner of public works granted most liberally the fencing required for the purpose.<note xml:id="ftn2" type="footnote" n="2">
