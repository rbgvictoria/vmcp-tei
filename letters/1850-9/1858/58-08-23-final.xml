I feel very much that you should desire the honor of publishing your own new discoveries, but the interests of science should be first consulted &amp; what we do now so much want is good observations on previously known plants. I wish too that you could publish in a more methodical form, it is extremely difficult already to refer to your published descriptions &amp; I am sure I omit referring to some that I would not intentionally give the go bye to — but life is short &amp; books are long &amp; the indifference of men of science to the convenience of posterity &amp; contemporaries in publication is leading to unavoidable confusion I am sure you will not think me censorious in saying so much, but the subject proper &amp; no one who has not worked in a great library and Herbarium has any conception of the amount of labor &amp; time lost in approaching completeness &amp; accuracy in descriptive Botany.</p>
