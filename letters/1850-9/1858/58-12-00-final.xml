A black Dingo was presented by All. Hugham Esq of Glenloth. Four large cases of living plants, purchased from Messrs Standish of London (an old &amp; respectable firm) arrived in excellent order. From the Rev. T. Beamish we received 2 fine Emus.

Altho' the Director will be happy to provide for the musicians as he has done throughout the last season some refreshment on his own private expense, it appears that the exertions of the band week after week deserves some more substantial acknowledgement. He would therefore take the liberty to enquire, whether it would not be desirable to devote a small sum (perhaps from 50-100 £) from any surplus fund of 1858 as a remuneration to be distributed between the Bandmaster &amp; the ordinary members of the band, from 20-30 of them being in attendance.</p>
