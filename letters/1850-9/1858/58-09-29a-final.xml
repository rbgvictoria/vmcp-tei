               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>Your Committee has the honor to report that a meeting was held on the 3rd instant, to take into consideration the appointment of a Committee, at a public meeting held at the Mechanics' Institution, on Tuesday, the 1st instant, on the subject of Australian Exploration, and at which Sir William F. Stawell presided. It was agreed that a deputation, consisting of Mr. R. H. Bland, Dr. Macadam, and the Chairman, should seek an interview with Sir William Stawell, and draw his attention to the existence of the Exploration Committee of the Philosophical Institute, and to the present position of the Institute in relation to Australian Exploration.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>The deputation was unfortunately unable to meet Sir W. Stawell at the time appointed by him, but, at the subsequent meeting of the Exploration Fund Committee, the following resolution was agreed to: "That while this Committee considers it to be its first duty to raise the sum of £2000 by subscription, in aid of the handsome donation of £1000 promised upon that condition, it is anxious to co-operate with the Exploration Committee of the Philosophical Institute in carrying out the objects which both Committees have at heart, and desires to impress upon the Exploration Committee of the Philosophical Institute the importance of urging upon the Government the necessity of placing a sum of money on the Estimates in aid of the Exploration of the Interior."</p>
