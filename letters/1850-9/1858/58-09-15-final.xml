               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>At a public meting held at the Mechanics' Institute, Melbourne, on the 1st inst., Sir W. F. Stawell in the chair, the undermentioned gentlemen were appointed a committee to take the necessary steps for raising £2,000 by public subscription, to be applied to the purpose of exploring the interior of the Colony; a donation of £1,000 having been made for that object, coupled with the proviso that double that sum should be subscribed by the public within twelve months from the present date. The committee, consisting of Sr W. F. Stawell, the Hon. J. Hodgson, M.L.C., Professor McCoy, Dr. Mueller, and Mr. James Smith, to which Dr. Macadam has been appointed Honorary Secretary, and Dr. Wilkie Treasurer, was limited in number, for the sake of securing a greater amount of individual responsibility as regards its financial administration; but as soon as it has discharged the first duty delegated to it — that of collecting the sum specified above — it is pledged to co-operate with the Exploration Committee of the Philosophical Institute, in concerting measures for the prudent, economical and efficient expenditure of the Exploration Fund. That Fund there is every reason to believe will be augmented by a grant from Government; and the aggregate amount, it is confidently hoped, will suffice to prosecute the enterprise to a thoroughly successful issue. In the mean time I have to solicit, on behalf of the Committee, the exercise of your local influence (either by the formation of sub-committees, or otherwise) in procuring subscriptions to an object which is national in character, and must secure the approbation of every Australian who is anxious to promote the material prosperity of his country, to enlarge the boundaries of knowledge, to clear up the mystery which envelopes the fate of poor Leichardt, and to facilitate our intercourse with the other hemisphere. The Government have promised to place a sum of money on the estimates for the introduction of twenty or thirty camels, to be employed in traversing the sandy deserts ascertained to exist in the interior, and the time appears to have arrived when we may undertake the work of exploration under the most favorable conditions of success, and may worthily emulate the laudable example which has been set us by the adjoining colonies.</p>
