                     <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>On the same page as this letter, the following report was made: ‘Dr. Mueller, the Government Botanist, and Director of the Botanic Gardens, has communicated to the Detective Police particulars of some apparently malicious injuries to the public property which have been committed within the last two days. On the afternoon of Wednesday, the 30th ult., the grass inside the reserve attached to the gardens was set on fire, it is supposed by some boys residing near the locality; and on the night of the 31st two of the tame animals kept in the wire inclosure were destroyed by dogs. Dr. Mueller is under the impression that this last injury was not caused by dogs accidentally getting at the animals, but that it was wilfully perpetrated, and he offers a reward for the conviction of the perpetrators. Should any of the acts above mentioned be brought home to any persons, they, perhaps, are not aware that the punishment would be very severe; and it is to be hoped they will not long elude the vigilance of the police.’</p>
