Dr. Mueller stated that — "the birds are mostly prospering, and there are many young canaries, although the parental birds were only received in autumn." Dr. Mueller added that there were several nests vacant, and with the view of setting loose a large number of young birds for naturalization, he earnestly besought the members and their friends for donations of female goldfinches and linnets, also thrushes, blackbirds, and nightingales. The Secretary recommended the request of Dr. Mueller to the attention of members.]</p>
