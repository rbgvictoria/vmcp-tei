W. ridge will have a splendid effect when attaining its full size. We were obliged to remove a large quantity of bad soil from where we planted these trees, and this has been used in forming partially the new walk along the lagoon between the menagerie and aviary. This walk is nearly completed.</p>

Pruning has been going on continually. Annuals are sown now all over the ground. Tenders have been called in for writing labels, a desideratum long felt, and I regret very much that these means of instruction to the Visitors could for want of adequate fund not be supplied already long ago. The planting of avenues as far as we can carry it out this season is completed.</p>

Garden are much more suitable for keeping the animals, than the basaltic flatts originally destined for their reception, whilst many forest trees and other plants, which it is almost hopeless to cultivate in our ground would thrive much better in the area of the zoological gardens, for which reason already an application was submitted to the honorable the Chief Secretary some months ago for a grant of the land situated between the zool. gardens and the Punt Road, and I would humbly pray that even now this piece of ground should be reserved for the extension of this establishment.</p>
