The society is very poor, never can be rich &amp; its funds are most properly expended in publishing, &amp; not in forming collections — we have no curator nor can we afford one, &amp; a vast quantity of plants are left there to be destroyed by dust &amp; insects. This is no one's fault. The Society did once make collections, but its power of doing so is long gone. We want members very much indeed, as the publications cost a great deal, &amp; our library which is of far greater importance than collections, is sadly neglected The object of such a society is to publish for the use of science, such papers or works as publishers cannot or will not undertake, to supply a good library for the use of members, &amp; to afford reunions for them — The Linnaean has no funded property, it lives from hand to mouth! We shall always be happy to publish your papers &amp; of those published in the Transactions we give 12 copies to the author. The expenses of the Journal are so great that we could not afford that, but allow an author to have 25 copies on paying the cost of printing &amp; paper. I took it on myself to order so many copies of your paper for you &amp; have seen that it is all right. We give all our publications gratis to members &amp; this we make a great point of doing but it is all we can do to afford it.</p>
