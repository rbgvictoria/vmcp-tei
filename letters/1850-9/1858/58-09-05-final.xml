The third of these was not published until 20 October. M is undoubtedly refering to the long article, 24 August 1858, pp. 4-5, which closely fits his description. The earlier one, published on 30 July, is a commentary on the newspaper's leading article about the recently completed journey by Augustus Gregory and his brother from Moreton Bay to Adelaide, and the geographical discoveries made; Clarke concluded this with some suggestions about the proper place to look for the remains of Leichhardt.</p>
               </note> — It contains various facts, of which I was previously not aware; and the contradictory accounts we have now before us, render this matter now very perplexing. Unless however positive evidence speaks to the contrary, I would rather bow to the superior judgement &amp; authentic observations of Mr Gregory in regard to these marked trees, than to the opinion of other observers. Let us however hope, that these mysterious circumstances may be cleared up with the least possible delay!</p>
