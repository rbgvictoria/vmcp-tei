T. Denison trusts that if Dr Mueller can be spared he will be allowed to accompany the Expedition alluded to' (O55/7217, unit 262, VPRS 1189, PROV). Governor Hotham commented, n.d.: 'I have no objection to Dr Mueller joining the Expedition as his expenses are paid from the funds provided for the purpose from the time of his arrival at Sidney.'
