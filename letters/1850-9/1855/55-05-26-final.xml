               </note> and after receiving your letter, I have consulted some of the members of the Legisl. Council of Victoria, in order to learn, whether probably my leaving for a lenght of time our establishment, would be sanctioned by them. I am sorry to inform you, that the result of these enquiries has been unfavourable, and that I am consequently obliged to abandon all thought of accompanying you, which would have been so delightful to me.<note xml:id="ftn2" type="footnote" n="2">

                     xml:lang="en">See also M to A. Gregory, 4 June 1855, in which M informs Gregory that he will be able to join the expedition after all. Gregory understood M's situation very clearly, as may be seen from his summary in a letter to his brother Francis, 11 June 1855: 'Dr Harvey has recommended Dr Mueller the Government Botanist at Melbourne, and Dr Mueller had applied for the appointment but a hitch had arisen about leave of absence the fact being that he wished to retain his situation while on the Expedition, and that the Government of Victoria appear to be very short of funds and wish to do away with the appointment he holds altogether, of course even with leave of absence his salary would not be borne by the Colony while he was on the Expedition' (Ag 34/5, Mitchell Library, State Library of New South Wales, Sydney). Once this final point became clear to the Victorian authorities, their objections to M's joining the expedition dissolved away.</p>
