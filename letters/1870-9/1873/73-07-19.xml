Wallis: 'The Honble The Minister of Lands &amp; Agriculture has instructed me to enquire under what circumstances certain books and instruments belonging to the establishment of the Botanical Garden were removed therefrom by the Govt Botanist. As Mr Wallis took delivery on my behalf, of the State property attached to the establishment of the Botanical Garden, he is requested to make the required enquiry'. Wallis wrote to M on 17 July requesting him: 'to append a list of the books and other property of the Botanical Garden which was not contained in the inventory presented to me on the 2nd inst, and also to state where such property now is.'</p>

It is daily required for his professional official work, and for his references and studies in the bot. Museum, the only place of office left to the Gov. Botanist, and was moved to that place when his former office residence was withdrawn from him. It was there shown on the 2. inst. to the Secretary of Agriculture by Mr G. Luehmann, the Gov. Botanist's Assistant. Such works as are from time to time required for his studies and researches in connection with his forthcoming volumes and other departmental publications are taken by the Gov. Botanist to his present working rooms. Beyond the instruments used in the Laboratory and shown there on the 2. inst by Mr Luehmann to the Secretary of Agriculture none have ever existed as public property of the Gov. Botanist Department either at the bot. Garden or elsewhere, all the costly microscopes and any other instruments being bought by the Gov. Botanist entirely out of his private means. No Library of any kind existed at the botanic Garden prior to the Gov. Botanists Directorship nor were ever any books bought out of the bot. Gardens vote, the only purchase being effected in 1866 by a special grant. Every facility is afforded to the public for the use of the Library at the bot. Museum, altho' the botanic section at the public Library in Melbourne is more generally frequented, it being far richer than that which the Gov. Botanist could form even [with the]<note xml:id="ftn2" type="footnote" n="2">
