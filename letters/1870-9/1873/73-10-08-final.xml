But you may have a chance of adding stray numbers occasionally to it. The misery, persecution and starvation in my Department brought even this work for 12 months last year to a complete stand-still, not to speak of the disturbance of so much other work. My Laboratory is closed since three months; the field branch was discontinued since 2 years; the lithographic work since 4 years. For Books no vote was forthcoming since 7 years; to my Museum building is not added since 14 years. I employ 2 assistants now on my private expense, and to my whole Department is left only £300 working expenses! I have sold the last property I had in the world to provide books &amp; maintain the communications with men of science. I sunk altogether about £8000 in my Department; the main branch, i.e. the Directorship of the bot Garden is given to a young Sydney Nurseryman.<note xml:id="ftn6" type="footnote" n="6">
