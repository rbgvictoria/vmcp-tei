               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>Ever since I was Director I sought to avoid unnecessary expenditure to applicants; they are accustomed to drive up for their plants to my office, and to take them at once away with them at a minimum of cost for conveyance and at the least sacrifice of time. Though I might instance much more on this subject of new and additional difficulties before me, I have said enough to ensure for an appeal to your good feelings a fair consideration, and I now therefore beg to ask whether it would not be more advisable to effect such alterations in reference to the existing rules, as you Sir may deem expedient, but then to entrust the action under such rules to the responsible Director. In the event of any alternations being intended in the existing rules, I would crave of your goodness to show me so much consideration, as to submit for my professional opinion such intended changes, before they become law.</p>
