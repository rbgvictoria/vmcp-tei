               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>I am in receipt of your’s of 4/11/72. &amp; much distressed to hear of your trials &amp; vexations. It is not easy for me to indicate or even suggest a course of action — but judging from what I gather from your friends here, of whom I have seen many &amp; warm ones — I am disposed so far to run the risk of intruding with the suggestion, that you should let matters rest for a few months; making no complaint &amp; no stir — &amp; when public attention is withdrawn from your present painful position, quietly consult a few of your many powerful friends about your future course; with a view to getting a thoroughly good active horticulturalist &amp; decorative gardener, to whom I should delegate the ornamenting &amp; practical gardening; you only interfering in the matter of general directions, Estimates &amp; so forth. This is the way in which I conduct this Garden, &amp; it is the only way that could answer — I am not a practical Gardener, nor a Florist; — I am a Botanist &amp; Landscape Gardener. I look to my Curator for growing all plants, &amp; for the amount &amp; kind of decoration required to gratify the public — He looks to me for 1. The general plan of the Garden; 2, the amount to be spent on decoration, — 3 power to cultivate according to his judgment. All internal <seg style="">
                  <hi rend="underline">arrangements</hi>
               </seg> of plants in stoves Houses &amp; beds, I order — subject to his assurance that they will grow well where I place them. He looks to me to provide seeds &amp; plants (except the merely decorative which he gets himself by orders countersigned by me) — &amp; for all information as to locations, climates &amp; conditions that the Botanical collections require.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>I can truly say that since I became Director, in 1865 not an unpleasant word has passed between us: &amp; that we have worked in perfect harmony — Just think over this — I really do not see how you can gratify the public without a floral display of the kind they like — nor how you can accomplish this without a Gardener skilled in the modern fashion of Gardening &amp; who should have a good deal of freedom of action. I set aside a specific sum for this purpose, &amp; the Curator has absolute control over it, subject to my approval of his plans &amp; action. So many men are allotted to it, who he engages &amp; dismisses, simply informing me of it, lest I should find reason to disapprove of his course.</p>
