               </note> it will be seen, that my health is much impaired, and as I am suffering much from recurrent bronchial catarrhs, lecturing of any kind will be impossible for me at present. I may add, that I am pervaded by such a high sense of professional honor as to render it sure, that the modest Salary (with allowance for House rent) voted by Parliament will not be spent on me without purpose. I am accustomed since an early orphanage to energetic and thoughtfully directed exertions; my time is far too valuable to be sacrificed in mere relaxation, and I must assure you, that my engagements will also henceforth not be unworthy of my scientific dignity in the world. Of this I trust to render tangible evidence by an official report at the end of the financial year to the satisfaction of yourself and Parliament, should I live till that period. It must however be kept in mind, that while large sums are voted for the Observatory and other scientific institutions, the whole vote for the working of my whole Department as that of Gov. Botanist is only now £300. - . -, but you may rest assured that the official responsibilities of my position will be met by me, so far as it will be possible within those narrow means. But as additional estimates are likely to be prepared, I hope that you will be pleased to augment the sum, placed for the maintenance of my Department at my Disposal, in order that the additional work, pointed out as desirable in my letter of the 23 June,<note xml:id="ftn6" type="footnote" n="6">
