Archer's address, which included a fulsome tribute to M, was published in the <seg style="font-style: italic; ">Argus</seg>, 11 October 1873, suppl., p.1.

As this covers only the Salary of one Museum Assistant &amp; the payment of some stationary &amp; incidentals, I have to bear out of my own Salary the payments of a Messenger, of a clerical Assistant, of all new books &amp; journals (this item alone at least £100 a year) office rent, (no Office room even left me) and so many other Departmental expenses, that I cannot exist, though I took merely refuge in a modest Hotel, after I was driven out of my Department after 22 years toil to create it! The reductions in the Department during the last few years were such, that I had to dispose of all my private property to continue my scientific relation with others and to carry on my independent researches.</p>

As you are a compeer of mine in the service since more than 20 years, I frankly mention this to you. Dr Hooker can of course not believe that his former colleague here has become so utterly ruined. My Office is in this Hotel since 4 months! The calls on me for information are just as great as before, though I have no Department left to carry on my work. Hardly any one has come near me here for 4 months, and even most of my friends think I have to complain of nothing and set themselves up as judges of my professional Department!</p>
