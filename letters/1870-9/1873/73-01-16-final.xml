Some of the new mountains and one of the Watercourses remained unnamed, the new geographic appellations to be chosen by the South Australian authorities. So far as a hurried perusal of the journals and maps allowed me to judge, I see great difficulties after the courageous exploit of Mr Giles, in continuing any exploration on the southern base of Macdonnell range, that range having been traced by Mr Giles to its western termination, about 150 miles from where Stuart struck it. It would be of importance, if the northern base of the MacDonnell Ranges could be explored.<note xml:id="ftn5" type="footnote" n="5">

The returning explorer notwithstanding his great experience, ability and perseverance, found himself repelled from further penetrating westward under his latitudes by the extraordinary want of water south and west of M'Donnell's Range and by the Saltmarshes to the south. He is however most eager to resume his explorations South of the great Amadeus Lake, especially as some high mountains were seen by him in that direction, and as the expeditions of Colonel Warburton and Mr Gosse will start several degrees farther north and will terminate at Swan River, Mr Giles in steering for the River Murchison<note xml:id="ftn8" type="footnote" n="8">

His expedition was entirely a private one, and solely undertaken in the cause of geography and cognate sciences. So will it be with his new enterprise. This latter however can be rendered more safe and more powerful in proportion to the means at Mr Giles disposal. Should therefore your honorable ministerial Colleagues and the other members of the Legislature of South Australia attach importance to the information now unconditionally afforded through me by Mr Giles, it may then become a subject of consideration, whether so worthy a man should experience some recognition and thus some additional means be gained for his new private travels.<note xml:id="ftn11" type="footnote" n="11">
