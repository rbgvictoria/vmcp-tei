Allow me to respond briefly to some of the objections, raised by you against some of the changes, which I proposed in the names of a few genera. Whatever may be the final view of phytographers about Candollea among Stylideae, there can be none concerning Candollea among Dilleniaceae, as it has not a single characteristic of its own &amp; merges completely into Hibbertia. If however the law of priority is to be subject to exceptions, then the question arises, where are these exceptions to commence, and where to end. "Nulla regula sine exceptione" could be well applied to the Thrixspermum of Loureiro on etymologic considerations, but Stylidium of that author is as clearly defined as Malotus, Trema, Centipeda, Derris, Galeola, Phajus and many others, which have been all reestablished, involving great changes in names long in use. In the Euphorbiaceae of the prodromus<note xml:id="ftn3" type="footnote" n="3">

               </note> (for instance) about 30 Rottleras became Mallotus species, altho' only one single Mallotus was named by Loureiro. So it was, as you are well aware, with Olearia, which, though counting but very few species, became the receptacle, of very numerous species of Eurybia, not to speak of many analogous cases. With Nageca instead of Podocarpus we has a similar case. In the great modesty, which caracterise all real sons of science, and so particularly your great father and yourself, I can last of all expect a consent from you on a question, in which your own pride and interest is concerned. The chronologic sequence of the genera Stylidium, Candollea &amp;c I have however again established after the indications, given on the subject by your father. The oversight of the first Stylidium by Swartz can however not cause its annihilation without an additional and more weighty cause. Phyllachre was also forgotten, but that cannot save now the Forstera of L. Fil.<note xml:id="ftn4" type="footnote" n="4">

               </note> The difference between Canlina of Maench &amp; Kennedya of Ventenot, as regards their names, is only one year, but it would be unjust to sacrifice Mench's labors on that account. Bentham acting on an uniform equitable and unexceptional principle of primogeniture has quite rightly readopted Cirscus in its original sense, altho changing thereby probably as many Cirscum species in generic name, as I venture to alter names of Stylideous plants.</p>
