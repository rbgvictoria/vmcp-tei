               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>[Baron von <seg style="">Mueller</seg> has received communications from Mr Ernest Giles, the Victorian explorer now in Central Australia, to the effect that his party is now leaving Beltana, amply provided, and that it is his intention to choose the Alburga (between the telegraph stations of Charlotte and Peake) for his first westerly course, the lower part of the Alburga only being known. As the Mount Olga Range trends far eastwards and likely also southward, no difficulty is likely to be encountered in choosing the shortest line in the manner indicated. The season in Central Australia has been hitherto unfavorable through rain for a westerly or north-westerly commencement of the new explorations. The party consists of three white men, and one aboriginal, the latter a companion of Mr. Giles' for many years in his former travels beyond the Darling River, but not with him in his last year's expedition.<note xml:id="ftn2" type="footnote" n="2">
