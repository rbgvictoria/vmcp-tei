However important my experience for field operations may be, I must feel, that I am no longer able to bear the privations of exploring as I was able when the elasticity of youth. It weighs also severely on my mind, that I must inavoidably retard by my absense from my homestudies the issue of the seventh and eighth volumes of the great work, on which I am engaged with Bentham,<note xml:id="ftn3" type="footnote" n="3">

Though my medical advisers or any other medical testimony could well bear witness, that I would be fairly entitled to a retiring allowance as almost worn out in my 21 years Victorian service, yet that allowance under the ordinary clauses of the civil service act would be so small, that I could not maintain out of it my dignity socially nor my labors scientifically. A very large sum was voted as a Donation by the British Parliament to Dr. Hooker. An equally large sum was voted a few years ago to the Rev. T.N. Clarke by the Sydney Parliament.<note xml:id="ftn4" type="footnote" n="4">

Clarke, to whom in 1861 the NSW Government awarded a grant of £3,000 for his part in the discovery of the Australian goldfields. In accordance with William Hooker's will offering his personal library and herbarium to the nation, the British Government purchased from his estate 'over 1 million herbarium specimens, 4000 volumes of publications, and about 29,000 letters dating from 1810 from over 4400 correspondents, bound in 76 volumes' (S. FitzGerald (2009), accessed 15 November 2020), the proceeds of which, £7,000, were then inherited by Joseph Hooker.</p>
