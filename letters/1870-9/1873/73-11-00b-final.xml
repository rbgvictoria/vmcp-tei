The text given here is from 'Transplanting aged cycads', in 'Home correspondence', <seg style="font-style: italic; ">Gardeners' chronicle</seg>, 3 January 1874, p. 18 (B74.01.02). It is dated to November 1872 as this is latest likely date that it could have been sent to have been included in this edition. It was probably written after M to L. Bernays, 8 November 1873, because, had he received by then Eugene Fitzalan’s letter quoted here, he would have been able to write more positively in the paragraph numbered 3 in the letter to Bernays.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>As in some instances the experiment of transplanting aged Cycad stems has failed through internal decay, I wish to relate the experience of Mr. Fitzalan on the subject—the gentleman who first, at my request, furnished Cycad stems, after my experiments with large South African <name key="Zamia">Zamia</name>e, and when I wished to ascertain whether the similarly organised Cycad species would endure the same process of moving at an advanced age. Mr. Fitzalan writes: — "When I sent you the first lot, I kept seven myself (from 3 to 4 feet high). Of these two made leaves in about six months, remained green for a month or more, and then decayed away. The others remained dormant till about a month ago (therefore over a year) when two more made fronds vigorously, and fine healthy tops. The other three are still dormant, but perfectly sound. As soon as I read your letter<note xml:id="ftn2" type="footnote" n="2">

               </note> I went (as desired) and carefully removed the earth off one of those which have fronds. I found that it had formed several fine succulent roots from the main root, each as thick as a finger." The possibility of moving Cycad stems with impunity is demonstrated therefore beyond doubt, and might be taken advantage of in the South Asiatic countries, from whence the transit to Europe can be effected so much more readily. I attribute the decay to internal concussion through careless throwing about on the way. To avoid this, Mr. Fitzalan now takes cases with him to the ranges, and packs the stems on the spot. The new steamer line through Torres Straits enables him to send stems thus with celerity to Europe. </p>
