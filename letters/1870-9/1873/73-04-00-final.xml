               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>It may interest some of your readers to know that I have proved the possibility of moving from distant localities very aged Cycad trunks, deprived of their leaves, and without any earth being left with their roots. Many months ago I succeeded in getting, from North Queensland, a stem of <name key="Cycas%20angulata">Cycas angulata</name> about 40 years old, which was sent as mere dead wood, like ordinary merchandise. The stem was more than a month out of the ground before it arrived here; it was planted in the centre bed of the Palm-house, and is now just pushing forth its foliage. All the <name key="Cycadeae">Cycadeae</name> are of very slow growth; to obtain a tall stately plant of any species would require many years' cultivation. This tedious process is now rendered unnecessary (as in the case of Fern trees) by shipping from native localities aged stems. For long sea voyages the trunks should be packed in cases, to prevent injury; thus the Indian and Chinese species would be rendered easily available in a fully developed state, although they do not attain the great height of one of the North-East Australian kinds. I have had large specimens of Natal <name key="Zamia">Zamia</name>s dormant for four years, and yet after applying bottom- heat they started into growth. </p>
