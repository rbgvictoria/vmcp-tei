               </note> to the requisitions attached I have the honor to submit, that the only existing portion of the botanic Museum building (the western wing) was caused by me to be constructed of Basalt. The intention of course was, that the middle portion and the eastern wing of the Museum should likewise be constructed of Basalt. But as £700 have been withdrawn from the building vote of the Botanic Garden for Gov. House Reserve, no means now exist to build the middle portion of the Museum as intended. As most urgently additional space at the Museum is required, it was deemed expedient to remove the small wood room annexed to the Museum and to build a handsome temporary annex of galvanized iron (similar to the temporary annex of the Exhibition Building) with an ultimate view of utilizing the material subsequently for nurseries-shades and similar necessary structures.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>Should you however be pleased, that at once a contract is taken of the originally designed middle portion of the Museum building in Basalt, then the cost of this above the £300 now only available for the purpose might be met out of the building votes of the botanic Garden in the new financial year, as it will require several months to construct the intended middle portion of the building, by which time new votes would become available.</p>

Wallis, commented: 'I have reported that the museum building is an unsightly structure, that it is situated about 200 yds from the Director's house, that it contains an extensive collection of dried plants, that the building and the plants contained therein appear to possess but few attractions for the public and are seldom if ever used by any but the Director or his employees, that much time and labour are lost by reason of it being so far removed from the Director's residence, that, moreover, the building greatly interferes with the improvements about to be effected in Govt House Domain, and I have suggested that, as it is proposed to expend money in additions thereto, it would, in my opinion, be the better course to do away with the existing building and to erect a new one on the piece of ground south of the Director's house, and t present occupied by common shrubs. Perhaps it would be advisable to have Mr [Sayce's] opinion on this matter?'</p>

Also to state the size &amp; accomodation that would be required in such buildg.' Wallis forwarded the file to the Inspector General of Public Works on 7 April: 'The additions to museum to stand over for the present, other works to be proceeded with.'</p>
