The <seg style="font-style: italic; ">Australian town and country journal</seg>, 7 June 1873, page 5, reported a telegram from Melbourne saying 'Dr. Baron von Mueller has been relieved of his position in the Botanical Gardens, and is appointed Government Botanist and Lecturer at the University, at a salary of £800 per annum'. The <seg style="font-style: italic; ">Newcastle chronicle</seg> (Newcastle, NSW), 3 June 1873, p. 2 carried the same paragraph in its item 'From the Sydney papers'.
