               </note> although it is with regret that I saw almost four years pass since my last communication to the Royal Society, and since my visit to your island, without being able to continue my collateral researches on Tasmanian plants either here or there. But during these three or four years my quiet unostentatious work was so much disturbed, by intrusions on my position, by harassing misrepresentations, and by the reductions of my means of working, that even my special publications here, during that, to me, sad period, did but little proceed. Even now I am quite uncertain whether I shall be able to effect any future progress in my literary labours, as I have no longer the means of a well-organised department, such as I formed many years ago in the botanic garden, at my command; and as I have hardly any other resources left than my modest salary, for scientific operations or writings of any kind. I state this at some length in order that I may free myself of the reproach of having done so little for the Society in late years.</p>

Thus, for instance, I refer in the pages now transmitted to a <name key="Lepyrodia">Lepyrodia</name>, altogether new for your island, and there, as yet, only gathered on one single spot. If, therefore, the members of the Society would aid me by sending sedges, rushes, and such like plants from as many localities as circumstances will permit, much interesting novelty and much of utilitarian importance also might come to light. Indeed, I would encourage collecting of any kinds of plants, by amateurs, anywhere, and would willingly examine such collections, which latter again would be formed in twofold series of specimens, so that the names, for instruction of the sender, might be communicated. I venture to draw the attention of the Society also to the remarkable fact that the fruit of the <name key="Donatia">Donatia</name> — a genus which I first proved many years ago to exist also in Tasmania — remained unknown up to the present day, although the original species was discovered in Fuegia<note xml:id="ftn9" type="footnote" n="9">
