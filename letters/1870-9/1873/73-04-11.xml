(now Colonel) Pasley, R.S., then Minister of public works, in its present position, that site being the only one well adapted within the area under my control as Director of the botanic Garden for such a structure, it being of the utmost importance that collections of dried plants, readily perishable through moisture, should be located on the highest rise free of all adflux of humidity. This principle is always designedly adhered to, and is as important as other considerations are for the choice of a site of an observatory.<note xml:id="ftn3" type="footnote" n="3">

As however during the last 14 years my collections have vastly increased, I would repeat for your friendly consideration my application for the extension of the building in accordance with the originally approved design. Thus the middle portion would next have to be constructed at an expenditure of about £800 in basalt, unless a temporary annex of iron was only provided, with a view of utilizing the material of the same subsequently for other purposes, as pointed out in my previous letter.<note xml:id="ftn4" type="footnote" n="4">

The existing portion of the building cost without the very extensive repositories — over one thousand pound Sterling; the repositories &amp;c have cost several hundred pounds Sterling.

While therefore the sum of £800 would provide the desired continuation of the building, a sum of nearly £3000 would be required, if a building entirely new was to be erected with no more space and accommodation as the £800 would provide, and with the prospect of injury and even ruin to the collections, which have rendered so far as plants are concerned this colony illustrious and on the formation of which the toils of my life have been largely spent for the last thirty four years.</p>

M responded on 3 May: 'As we are now already in the eleventh month of the financial year, and as this requisition could first be presented only on the 11. Nov. 1872 in consequence of the deferred votes, I fear that the sum intended for the extension of my Museum may lapse unless it can early be brought under contract. Should the recommended extension not yet be decided on, then I would respectfully request to be allowed to substitute an other requisition for other likewise urgent building-work, for which out of the vastly decreased vote at my present disposal I could not provide. Otherwise the sum, set under requisition apart for the Museum purposes may be entirely lost to my Department.'
