Woolls, 15 December 1876, to which it is attached in the Mitchell Library's bound volume of Woolls's correspondence, and M to W. B. Clarke, 25 December 1876. This suggests that it was probably written either as a second letter to Woolls on Friday 15 December 1876, or on the following Friday, 22 December 1876.</p>

Clarke in which he advocated better conservation of forests, published in the <seg style="font-style: italic; ">Sydney morning herald</seg> on 4 November 1876, attracted fierce criticism from L.

               </note> Every tree is a factor (however individually insignificant in the total sum) in the calculation of temperature. The formula is a very simple one: vapor is water plus heat. Water is vapor minus heat. To retain water or condense vapors by trees is reducing heat, and this effect we cannot extend too much in a country like Australia with its hot dry summer winds. Let pastoral animals enjoy as much shade as they can get, and cool with foliage as much area as you can in our country, though the superabundance of overwet jungleforests of tropical forests in fern regions must be reduced and opened up for aeration and evaporation. We need not fall from one extreme to the other. Were I to advocate extreme measures, then the word "pedant" hurled at me undeservedly<note xml:id="ftn3" type="footnote" n="3">

Destruction of foliage by insects: ultimate effect of bush fires. Seasons of unusually severe frosts.
