Read, wrote to Odgers: 'I have the honor to acknowledge receipt of your favor of the 12 instant, as also receipt of three cases of seeds, referred to in that letter. I am directed by the Council to return you their sincere thanks for this handsome donation, and to assure you that the experiment of sowing the seed in sandy soils on the coast shall be carefully conducted, and every care taken to give the seeds a fair chance of germinating. The cases have been opened and found to contain in equal proportions, "Elymus arenarius", "Psamma arenarius", and "Arundo arenarius"; this you will percieve differs from the description given in your letter, as the "Arundo arenarius" has been apparently substituted for the two species of Sand Lupin, namely "Lupinus Arboreus" and "Lupinus albiflorus". A sample parcel of each seed will be forwarded to Dr Mueller, as requested, also a similar portion to the Borough of Portland, and the remainder will be divided between the Borough of Belfast and Warrnambool.'
