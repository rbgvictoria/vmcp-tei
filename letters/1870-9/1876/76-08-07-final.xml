               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>Ever since that time I have preserved a desire, to be the founder of an estate there, but I have deferred taking any active step, as the area was so far out of reach of communication; and hence I did not follow up some suggestions, which were made to me by his Excellency Governor Weld and the honorable Fred. Barlee, by which I might, prior to the establishment of responsible Government in your colony, have become [possessed] of a small portion of the ground, which I helped to discover, and this on the most generous terms, then offered by your Government. At my now advancing age and without any landed property in any of the Australian colonies I am more eager than ever, to connect my name and rank with a territory in your colony, especially with one which I aided to explore. I may observe, should your Government be generously inclined to facilitate the realisation of my wishes, that I have been now nearly 30 years in Australia uninterruptedly, that in this long period I have necessarily been engaged at the sacrifice of all private property and of domestic-life to advance the knowledge of resources of all Australia by the elucidation of its plants, by pushing geographic research, by a most extensive correspondence and by all other means within my reach.</p>

Although the Colonial Office had been of the view that the expedition should be sponsored jointly with the governments of the Australian colonies, it eventually sponsored and funded it alone, 'ostensibly to avoid the delay of protracted correspondence', with responsibility for local organization delegated to the colony of New South Wales.
