               </note> your favorable consideration for the resuscitation of my Department in its proper scope. The report of the above named Gentlemen, who were appointed by the hon Graham Berry, to advise him respecting the means, required by me for the proper functions of Gov. Botanist, was submitted long ago, but I have not sought to obtain an insight into this document, being assured, that what the Committee recommended would be reasonable and just. I believe however, that I shall be in consonance with the general views of the Committee on my case, if I beg of you, to cede to me the buildings, now occupied as temporary almhouses or immigrants homes at the City bridge, it being doubtless the intention of the Government to remove early the paupers from the close vicinity of Government House, on sanitary considerations.<note xml:id="ftn3" type="footnote" n="3">

               </note> I would further ask, in probable conformity of the Committee's recommendation, that all the ground in Gov. House reserve, not enclosed for the private use of His Excellency the Governor, be allotted to my control, from the boathouses up to the St Kilda Road and towards the Barracks and the vicinity of the Observatory. It needs not my explanation, that in a clime like ours a few acres would be utterly insufficient for my purposes, as a full collection of different trees from all parts of the globe, so far as hardy here, would occupy alone a very extensive area, not to speak of the numerous other kinds of plants, which as Gov. Botanist I should have in a <seg style="">
