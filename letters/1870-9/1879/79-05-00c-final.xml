               </note> of Canon <seg style="font-variant: small-caps; ">King</seg> (son of Admiral <seg style="font-variant: small-caps; ">King</seg>), you will perceive that this gentleman was the original discoverer of the <name key="Bolbophyllum%20minutissimum">Bolbophyllum minutissimum</name>, of which until now I was not aware, but you will also notice that the genus Bolbophyllum was in Mr. W. S. <seg style="font-variant: small-caps; ">M'Leay's</seg> time not known and recognised as Australian, the plant having been lost during the last twenty years, during which period I successively published the ten Bolbophylla now known. I was not aware of the suggestion of Canon <seg style="font-variant: small-caps; ">King</seg>; that the plant might be called Dendrobium nummulifolium, a designation which would have been more suitable than D. moniliforme, if the leaves or pseudobulbs were only larger, for they are flat and thus certainly more coin-like than bead-like. In saying 'leaves or pseudobulbs,' I must add that I hesitated from the beginning to acknowledge the disk-like leafy organs as leaves, and considered the probability of their pseudobulbous nature, but did not introduce the ambiguity of the subject, as I ought to have done, in the designation. What led me to assume them to be leaves was the affinity of B. lichenastrum to the minute species under discussion, the leaves of the former being also very small and depressed, and also unaccompanied by pseudobulbs. Still the leaves of B. lichenastrum are nearly basifixed, whereas the disk-like bodies of B. minutissimum are half adnate to rootlets. Possibly the extremely minute awl-shaped processes, occasionally arising from the disks, may indicate rudimentary leaves, and may sometimes assume larger size and expression of really leafy significance. Sir <seg style="font-variant: small-caps; ">Geo. M'Leay</seg>, whose friendship I also enjoy, must, after so long a time, be misled by his memory in stating that the B. minutissimum was always known, as he says in the <seg style="font-style: italic; ">Gardeners' Chronicle</seg>, as B. moniliferum;<note xml:id="ftn3" type="footnote" n="3">

This Orchid was discovered by the Rev. Robert King, of Morris College, Liverpool, New South Wales, an accomplished botanist, named by him Bolbophyllum moniliforme, and presented by him to my brother. It flowered I believe every year, and was never supposed to be of any other genus.</p>

Perhaps this memorable Orchid should rather be called the dwarfest than the smallest, inasmuch as the roots are elongated, and as thus one individual plant is provided with a multitude of disk-like pseudobulbs or leaves, although in height even <name key="Malaxis%20paludosa">Malaxis paludosa</name>, in its smallest forms, is a giant compared to it.</p>
