                     <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>In answer to our reporter's queries Baron von Mueller said :—Mr. A. Forrest was equipped by the West Australian Government, with a view of exploring the country from Grey river to Port Darwin, within the boundaries of their colony, as it was considered so very eligible for pastoral settlement. I was with Gregory myself inland of those localities, when we found splendid pastoral country at Stuart's [typesetter’s error for Sturt’s?] Creek; and when I was in West Australia two years ago I urged on the Government their sending out an expedition to connect the southern districts with Port Darwin, by an exploration route, to open it up for the squatters, also to bring it in connection with the pastoral country of Stuart's Creek, there being fine harbors too, such as King's Sound, Camden Harbor, and Cambridge Gulf, from which places the produce, such as wool, tallow, and hides, could be shipped, besides horses to India, at comparatively short distance. The same idea has prevailed already there, but my urging it gave an additional impetus. A few months ago Mr. Forrest had discovered already four million acres of grand country, near King's Sound. He informs me of further discoveries, and that he has kindly prepared a large collection of plants, etc., for me, and forwarded them. He was not specially sent out to look for Leichardt, but he might have fallen in with some traces of him. Since he does not mention any, I presume he has found none.</p>

(Forrest (1980), p. 38). M's telegram has not been found, but was probably sent upon receipt of Forrest's telegram.</p>
