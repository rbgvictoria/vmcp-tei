                     <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>The proposal was not approved at that time, and on 20 November 1879 Forrest wrote again to the Governor, H. Ord: 'As I feel personally rather ashamed of having put my friend Baron Mueller to the trouble of writing this valuable essay &amp; not utilizing it, I hope Your Excellency may now be able to sanction its publication, either in the form of a Council paper or in a small pamphlet, as my recent letters from the Baron give me the impression that he is very anxious for its appearance and seems hurt at the delay'. In an annotation dated 15 December 1879 on Forrest's memorandum, Fraser stated: 'This may be very valuable at a later period after the question of a "Special Settlement North district" has been decided on. Its publication then will probably be very desirable.' The same day a further minute was added in a different hand, probably that of the Governor, H. Ord: 'I agree with S. G. [Surveyor General].' On 16 December 1879 Ord, minuted: 'C S [Colonial Secretary] You will of course give the Govt Printer instructions that it is not to interfere with the progress of his current work but is to be done as opportunity offers'.</p>
