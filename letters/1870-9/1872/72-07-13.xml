               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>Certain statements having been made by the Forest Inspector, during the week as reported in the Daily papers, in reference to the cutting of flowers, in the Botanic Garden, by Industrial School Boys, I may be allowed to state, that I generally cut the flowers for Public fetes &amp;c myself, and never heard of or saw any of those boys cutting them. I have when there have been large quantities wanted for Public fetes, taken one boy with me to carry them, as it is awkward to cut, and carry them at the same time, but have never let the boy come on the beds, nor, as a rule, stepped on them myself, but when I have had occassion so to do, I left no footprints behind, but erased them, especially on newly dug borders.</p>

Casey, on 13 July 1872 noting: 'I may be allowed to add, that flowers are cut only for public purposes under a clause of the rules and never for private objects.' On 19 July 1872 Pitcher's letter was: 'Referred to Mr Ferguson for any remarks he may wish to submit relative to this letter'. On 22 July Ferguson informed C. Hodgkinson, the Assistant Commissioner of Lands &amp; Survey: 'In reference to the letter of Frederick Pitcher dated 13th inst addressed to Baron von Mueller in which he challenges my statement made before the honorable the Minister of Lands in reference to boys being permitted to cut flowers and trample on the borders in the Botanical Gardens. I would beg leave most respectfully to repeat that statement, and in support of what I did say on that occasion I find on referring to my diary kept during the years 1870, 1871, and the early part of the current year that <seg style="">
                        <hi rend="underline">I have very frequently had occasion to remonstrate with Frederick Pitcher on the slovenly manner, he, along with several boys employed in the gardens trampled on the shrubbery borders when cutting flowers &amp;c, transferring the earth from the borders to the walks and otherwise destroying that neat appearance which I am desirous of producing and which all well kept gardens ought to present to the public eye</hi>
                     </seg>. — <space unit="chars" quantity="1"/>As a practical Gardener, of more than thirty years experience I most respectfully beg leave to protest against such intrusions being permitted in the Melbourne Botanic Garden where practical men are employed and instructed to carry out order and neatness. I would also beg to state that Frederick Pitcher is one of the junior messenger boys employed in Baron Von Muellers office and in no way connected with the practical department of the Botanical Gardens.'
