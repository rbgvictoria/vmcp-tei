               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>Certain statements having been made by the Forest Inspector, during the week as reported in the Daily papers, in reference to the cutting of flowers, in the Botanic Garden, by Industrial School Boys, I may be allowed to state, that I generally cut the flowers for Public fetes &amp;c myself, and never heard of or saw any of those boys cutting them. I have when there have been large quantities wanted for Public fetes, taken one boy with me to carry them, as it is awkward to cut, and carry them at the same time, but have never let the boy come on the beds, nor, as a rule, stepped on them myself, but when I have had occassion so to do, I left no footprints behind, but erased them, especially on newly dug borders.</p>

Hodgkinson, the Assistant Commissioner of Lands &amp; Survey: 'In reference to the letter of Frederick Pitcher dated 13th inst addressed to Baron von Mueller in which he challenges my statement made before the honorable the Minister of Lands in reference to boys being permitted to cut flowers and trample on the borders in the Botanical Gardens.
