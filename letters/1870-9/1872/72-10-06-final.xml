               </note> I deeply sympathize with yourself, and never believed it possible that you, the master of us all in official life, should have encountered such a series of difficulties in your own lofty position, when it came to you with the halo of your father's illustrious name, arisen in the last century already. Your difficulties however have been but little compared to mine, and I have no Earl Derby to defend me in a House of Lords. It is utterly incomprehensible to me, why Prof. Owen should be antagonistic to yourself. Great as he is — uncomparably great — as a palaeontologic and anatomic zoologist, the illustrious man can not possibly be a judge also of a phytographic Department or of a Museum of industrial vegetable objects.<note xml:id="ftn2" type="footnote" n="2">

The preceding 'Summary for Europe', 16 July 1872, had carried a report of the meeting between the Minister of Lands, M and William Ferguson: 'it seemed pretty evident that since Mr. Ferguson had been appointed to the practical charge of the gardens he had ignored the director, and that the director had ignored him; while, in the meantime, the gardens had been retarded and not improved' (p. 1S).</p>
