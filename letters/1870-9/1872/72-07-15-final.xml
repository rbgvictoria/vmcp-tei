On the debit side, 'it is undeniable that ... as a Government officer he is a most difficult person to deal with. He is constantly obtruding himself upon ... the public, and generally as an object of sympathy ... People known to have some little influence with the Government or the public — as members of Parliament, for instance — dare not visit the botanical gardens ... lest they be compelled to listen to a tedious story of his labours, or a pitiful narrative of his sufferings and wrongs ... his undignified subserviency has done most to alienate him from the esteem of the public.' The article goes on to comment on the long-running 'grievous complaint' which led to the Government putting 'Mr FERGUSSON, inspector of state forests, in charge of the grounds, in order that he, a practical landscape gardener might bring them into order'.

The dispute between M and Ferguson is rehearsed, and the view of the Board of Inquiry that the positions of Government Botanist and curator should be distinguished and defined is reported.

The article continues with comment on the interview recently held between James Casey, President of the Board of Lands and Works, M and Ferguson, 'that their differences might be arranged, if that were possible, [as the Estimates for the year were being prepared]. And again the Baron's wrongs had to be related with painful iteration<space unit="chars" quantity="1"/>—<space unit="chars" quantity="1"/>how a gentleman was placed on the board of inquiry who was personally hostile to him...’ [M underlined ‘gentleman’ and in the margin against this point wrote: 'who just before said in print "I should botanize on my mother's grave!"'] In concluding, the<space unit="chars" quantity="1"/>
