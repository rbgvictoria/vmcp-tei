                     <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>After receiving notice of a question from Mr W. Clarke alleging 'misappropriation of Government property by the distribution of trees and plants for the purpose of beautifying a private park or garden situated at Point Nepean', Casey, Minister of Lands, had 'directed that information should be obtained from the only two officers in the Department who could possibly have any knowledge of the transaction'. A newspaper paragraph naming the Hon C. G. Duffy as the owner of the private garden in question was sent to William Ferguson and, presumably, also to M (letters not found), and their reports requested. The replies were reported in the Legislative Assembly when Casey answered the question. William Ferguson reported that he had distributed no plants to the Hon C. G. Duffy. </p>

Duffy, or any other property of that gentleman. But on the 15th and 29th June of this year, four kinds of creeping grasses were supplied to Mr Duffy, and small quantities of twelve kinds of seeds of other plants, for an experiment to bind drift sand at Sorrento, this supply having been furnished under the 6th clause of regulations.

Duffy demanded a 'full, clear and unequivocal withdrawal of this slander', pointing out that his garden was over a mile from the park. In his assurance that the <seg style="font-style: italic; ">Argus</seg> 'had no intention whatever' of accusing him of misappropriation of the plants, the editor argued that M's report had left 'a general misapprehension … in the House' that Duffy was the 'custodian' referred to (<seg style="font-style: italic; ">Argus</seg>, 10 December 1872, p. 6).</p>
