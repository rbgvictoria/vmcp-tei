It is introduced by<seg style=""> 'We have been favored by Mr. Bernays with the following extract of a letter received from Baron von Mueller</seg>:—'. Given his official position in the Qld government and the title used, the addressee is almost certainly Lewis Bernays rather than his brother Dr Albert Bernays with whom no correspondence has been found. The letter is dated to January 1872 on the assumption that Bernays would have made its contents available to the press soon after he received it; but it could have been written as early as mid-November 1871; see M to C. Birch, 10 November 1871 (in this edition as 71-11-10a).</p>

                     xml:lang="en">it is recorded that the explorers daubed a lake which they came across … as well as two hillocks, with the barbarous cognomens of certain barons and doctors. The first of these worthies is described as a “field marshal who visited the Australian shores about a year ago.” The other “made an expedition into Spitzbergen and the new King Carl’s Land.” Good reasons truly for inflicting their names upon the landmarks of Queensland! And this is daubed scientific research; and such are the means taken to perpetuate the names of scientific men. It will be a fraud upon the good nature of this country if the inflictions are ever allowed to appear in print.</p>
