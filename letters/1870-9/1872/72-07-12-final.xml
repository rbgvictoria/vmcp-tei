               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>Perhaps by this time you thought I had passed the bounds of all civilisation, but I have had so many delays and drawbacks, that I am now thankful to be so far on my route to the west. I can sum up all my troubles and annoyances as arising from the want of grass. Really the country from Port Augusta to Mount Margaret is a perfect desert, and what may surprise you, it is a stony one. I can describe the whole region in a few words, as it is almost a treeless and shrubless stony plain for hundreds of miles, and the stony region extends beyond Lady Charlotte Waters.<note xml:id="ftn3" type="footnote" n="3">

               </note> The River Finke is the first, which traverses a sandy or soft country, and I shall be most heartily glad when I reach its banks. I have at last reached the region of grass, and my remaining horses are beginning to improve. I had to re-shoe the whole of them here. Heavy rains fell a fortnight ago, and flooded all the small creeks and most of the large ones. It has also been raining all to-day, and has evidently set in for the night. I have every reason to expect a most prosperous trip across to the Murchison River.<note xml:id="ftn4" type="footnote" n="4">

               </note> I have been joined by a young stockman named Alexander Robinson, so that now my party is quite complete. The nearer I get to the unexplored regions, the more light-hearted I feel, as I am so fully confident of my getting across, though the horses I have had, and the delays and vexatious I have had to put up with, have at times almost made me cranky. However, affairs never looked brighter. I have fourteen and shall most probably have sixteen horses when I leave Charlotte Waters, and I hope then to be disencumbered with any vehicle. This station is the head-quarters of the Mount Margaret run. It is forty miles north-west of that mount, and is the furthest stock station in this province. I have collected a few specimens of flowering shrubs and other plants from the country round the southern shores of Lake Eyre up to this place. I send them in a separate parcel. With regard to the fall of waters in this part of the continent, it appears to me and others who are competent to judge, that all those which flow south or south-east of the MacDonnell Range empty into Lake Eyre, which is a very important feature, as some day this will no doubt be the highway for water carriage into this interior, as it is simply the northern extremity of the ancient Spencer's Gulf continued through Lake Torrens to Lake Eyre. Doubtless some day it will be reconnected by a canal with the sea.<note xml:id="ftn5" type="footnote" n="5">

That gentleman, upon whose opinion I set great value, advised me to make that range my point of departure.
