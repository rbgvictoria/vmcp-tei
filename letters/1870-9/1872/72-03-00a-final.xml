Bacchus to the Ballarat Farmers' Club on 16 March 1872 (<seg style="font-style: italic; ">Leader</seg> [Melbourne], 23 March 1872, p. 7), a continuation of the lecture he presented to the Club on 17 February 1872 (see M to W. Bacchus, 1872 (in this edition as 72-00-00)). In the lecture, Bacchus referred to other communications from M besides the one mentioned here and identifications of grasses by him, almost certainly in a series of letters. The date given here is the latest that M could have written to him before the lecture. </p>

Baron von Müller is the only person to whom I can have recourse for information; latterly he has not had time to assist me in identifying specimens.

At the April meeting of the Club, 'Mr Bacchus exhibited two very neat specimens of native grasses, dried and attached to paper. He said they were samples to: show what Dr Müller proposed to do, viz., to issue at £1- each books containing fifty specimens of native grasses duly named. The specimens exhibited by Mr Bacchus showed roots, leaves, and bloom of the grasses, and were really pretty pictures in themselves, apart from their interest and value to the farmer. Several members of the committee spoke approvingly of the project.' (<seg style="font-style: italic; ">Ballarat star</seg>, 8 April 1872, p. 4). M’s proposal did not, however, go ahead: he did not issue exsiccatae of grasses. </p>
