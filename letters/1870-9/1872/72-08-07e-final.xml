The present letter is therefore dated to 7 August 1872 on the assumption that the printer inadvertently named the wrong month.</p>

               </note> He may, moreover, be guided by the lay of the country and the occurrence of water, into other directions, and come out elsewhere in your territory. This brave man, with his little and courageous band, will be utterly helpless when he arrives in West Australia, should he at all be able to accomplish his task. But if he succeeds, he will have high claims on your Government and Parliament, in as much as he will have opened for your settlements an overland road to and fro, to communicate with three of the Eastern colonies. Moreover, he will have given you a base line, so to say, for future operations north and south, and I can foresee, that with a line of good position on Giles' track to start from, the young Messrs. Forrest will dash forward on one side, while Mr. Giles, with his great experience, and with his modest requirements, might be entrusted with the exploration of the country on the other side of his line. For, what use is the immense extent of its territory to West Australia if it cannot be occupied, and for occupation the paths must be opened by exploration.</p>

The brave leader has sunk <seg style="font-style: italic; ">his all</seg> in the enterprise, and has now to depend on the generosity and gratitude of your country for his reward. I believe that Mr. Carmichael has spent all he had also in this venture. I have helped a little, so far as I could, after confiding a fortune for science and my department.</p>
