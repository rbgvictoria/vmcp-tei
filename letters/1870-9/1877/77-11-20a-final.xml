               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>Sir enclosed are two specimens of Plants found by my youngest son on the Pine Mountain — I expect you remember this mountain. It is one huge mass of Rock — with a little soil distributed here and there in the crevases and gullies — the accumulation of ages This mountain is rich in plants and trees I should like to thoroughly examine it in company with some good Botanical guid. If please God all goes well I mean to have a try to ascend it in the autumn with a crew to collect plants for cultivation I have a nice few specimens that the boy has gathered there. The one I enclose with yellow flowers is from a tree found in a most inaccessible gully on one side of the Pine Mountain it is very questionable if it ever was fisited by any collector before my boy went there and he certainly would not have got into it if he had have been by himself. He had a good man with him a Swiss that has a selection at the foot of the mountain The tree from which the yellow flowered specimen was obtained was about 15 feet high — the sight I believe was something to be Remembered I should like to know its name. The little small leaved plant also that was got there. I also send a specimen of a <name key="Grevillia">Grevillia</name>

The boy describes the flowers as pure white — they do not look very white now — the main difference seems to be in the foliage it is much broader any how you will know.</p>
