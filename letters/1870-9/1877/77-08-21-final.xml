                     xml:lang="en">The file includes a letter written by John Fairfax &amp; Sons on 3 September 1877 to Victoria’s Chief Secretary, G. Berry: 'Recently was published a book, on the authority of the Victorian Government, entitled "Introduction to Botanic Teaching." We have seen the work, and highly approve of it. In the hope of diffusing botanical knowledge among the classes, we applied to the author, Baron F. von Mueller, relative to reprinting the book, but that gentleman has advised us to make a direct application to you, we now most respectfully ask you to grant us permission to reprint the book in the columns of the <seg style="">
                        <hi rend="underline">Sydney Mail</hi>
                     </seg> newspaper, together with the favour of a loan of the wood engravings used in the work. Should it not be desirable to lend the woodcuts, we shall be willing to pay a reasonable charge for electrotypes'. This letter was referred to M for comment on 7 September. He replied the same day (see M to W. Odgers, 7 September 1877), urging that the proposal be considered favourably 'as the reproduction of the little book will do credit to Victoria in the sister-colony, will cost us nothing and promote our knowledge elsewhere'.</p>
                  <p rend="Footnote"
                     style="font-family: Geneva, Geneva; margin-left: 0.3335in; margin-right: 0in; text-indent: -0.3335in; font-size: 9pt; "
                     xml:lang="en">

                     <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>On 10 September the Under Secretary, W. Odgers, asked the Government Printer, J. Ferres, for a 'report in regard to the wood cuts'. Ferres replied the next day: 'The drawing and engraving of the illustrations to the work cost £230, and an edition of 3000 copies was struck off. An individual in this Colony purchasing a copy must pay 2s/6d for it; but, supposing the Messrs. Fairfax's request acceded to, a copy could be procured in N.S.W. for sixpence. Even though it may be desirable to disseminate botanical knowledge among the classes, it would seem but just that the community who has borne the expense of originally publishing such information should be able to procure it as cheaply as one who has not borne any. Both the "Leader" and "Australasian" have an extensive circulation in the country districts of this Colony and also N.S.W.; and therefore, if it be expedient to republish this work in a newspaper, their claim to consideration should be prior to the "Sydney Mail." I cannot recommend the loan of the woodcuts because of their liability to damage. The expense of electrotyping would be about £24. But it is proper to observe that as electrotypes are in every respect equal to the woodcuts themselves, the supplying of electrotypes to Messrs Fairfax [would] virtually be presenting them with £230 — the value of the woodcuts.' Ferres's statement that a copy could be procured in NSW for sixpence assumes that the whole work would appear in a single issue of the <seg style="font-style: italic; ">Mail</seg>, but in fact there were 22 instalments so that the cost to a NSW subscriber would be 11/-, substantially more than the cost of buying the book.</p>

The cost of Electrotypes of the Illustrations would be £24. I shall be glad to be informed if you wish them to be prepared.' (Unit 47, p. 323, VPRS 1187/P, VA 475, PROV).</p>

Odgers requested Ferres to supply the books (10 October) and the electrotypes (11 October) (Unit 47, p. 431, VPRS 1187/P, VA 475, PROV). In forwarding the two copies of the book to J. Fairfax &amp; Sons on 11 October, he reported at the same time that the Government Printer had been instructed to send them the electrotypes (Unit 47, p. 432, VPRS 1187/P, VA 475, PROV).</p>

Odgers replied on 16 October giving permission for Messrs Walker, May &amp; Co. to proceed (Unit 47, p. 473, VPRS 1187/P, VA 475, PROV). Ferres informed Odgers on 1 December that the electrotypes had been despatched to J. Fairfax &amp; Sons, and enclosed an account for £20.6.0 (L77/13292, unit 982, VPRSE 3991/P, PROV). Odgers forwarded the account to J. Fairfax &amp; Sons on 12 December (Unit 47, p. 1173, VPRS 1187/P, VA 475, PROV), who sent a cheque to G. Berry on 18 December (L77/13292, unit 982, VPRS 3991/P, PROV) which was acknowledged by Odgers on 28 December (Unit 47, p. 1329, VPRS 1187/P, VA 475, PROV) and forwarded to Ferres the same day. On 3 January 1878 Ferres sent Odgers a receipt for the cheque from Messrs Walker, May &amp; Co. (L77/13992, unit 982, VPRS 3991/P, PROV) which Odgers forwarded to J.
