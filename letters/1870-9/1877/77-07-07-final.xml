The Spaniards at their conquest more than 300 years ago took the <name key="Ceratonia">Ceratonia</name> at once to South America, but I doubt whether they would have set the same value on the Prosopis, which as yet is not cultivated in the countries at the mediterranean Sea.

Mr Thomson's idea, that the germinating of the seeds in the stomach of the horses causes their death, is surely based on some erroneous conceptions. Even if after crushing or mastication any germs were developed, which I consider unlikely, they would rather be in a state to serve for assimilation into chyme &amp; chyle. I deem it far more likely, that the enormous quantity of catecho-tannic acid, known to exist in the pericarp of Prosopis, acts as a powerful adstringent on the coat of the stomach, dries up the mucous secretion and gastric use,<note xml:id="ftn6" type="footnote" n="6">

The Board recommended that M be allowed a garden, staff, a laboratory, and that the museum be enlarged or a more suitable building provided (see L. Smith to G.

The <seg style="font-style: italic; ">Argus</seg>, in opposing the proposal, considered that the board 'is composed entirely of gentlemen who are generally friendly to the Baron' and that as soon as possible he should be given a retiring allowance, since although 'it is right that the colony should foster science, it need not bestow its patronage on those votaries who give to grumbling and intrigue the time which should be devoted to honest labour' (<seg style="font-style: italic; ">Argus</seg>, 14 July,1877, p. 6).</p>
