                     xml:lang="en">That is, following William Harvey's death, to take his place in the continuation of Harvey &amp; Sonder (1859-65). Mueller had earlier written to Barkly asserting that it was 'national jealousy' that denied Sonder the authorship, telling him that Sonder had completed work on the Ericineae and had started on the Corolliflorae (letter not found; see, in the same volume, H. Barkly to J. Hooker, May 1871, f. 170). However, Hooker was adamant that Sonder was the person neither for the task nor as a collaborator:</p>

                     <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>As to Mueller's proposal to employ Sonder, it is out of the question. I know the honest fellow well — he was a constant drag on the work - his portions are often miserably ill done, and poor Harvey had not only to revise all his descriptions, but to translate them into English! Add to this that 5 years elapsed after Harvey's death before I could get back the materials (Heaths) that Sonder had borrowed from the Herbarium at Kew </p>

I have talked to him most seriously about it now many times.

Thiselton-Dyer, published in 1896-97. Vol. 4 was published between 1904 and 1909, with the Ericaceae enumerated anew by a number of botanists. Thiselton-Dyer explained the delay as caused by 'the pressure of official duties in which I almost immediately found myself immersed' and by 'the rapid expansion of British South Africa [which] led to a continuous influx to Kew of new material'. Thus 'during the last twenty years the time of one member of the Kew staff has been almost exclusively occupied with the determination of South African plants' (Thiselton-Dyer (1896-1925), vol. 6, pp. v-vi). </p>
