               </note> as collector of plants and seeds for our botanic Garden. These sad tidings come quite unexpected, as with the exception of an illness, from which he suffered for a short time some months ago, he was always well and continuing in vigorous strength. The immediate cause of his death was typhoid fever. I may add, that one of his sons in law and his eldest daughter are settled with their children at Rockingham's Bay, that he felt most pleased with his position and occupation, that he even wished very recently to go to New Guinea for collecting (to which request I could not consent, no settlements existing there) and that I never hindered him in his discretionary judgement in forming the plans of his operations at Rockingham's Bay, so that his position might be as comfortable as I could render it. I have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant</p>

Hyndman wrote to the newly appointed Chief Secretary, Charles Gavan Duffy, applying for the position of Government Seed and Botanical Collector. See also W. Odgers to M, 25 August 1871 (in this edition as 71-08-25a), and M to C. Duffy, 30 August 1871, in which M confirmed that he was 'most anxious' to replace Dallachy.</p>
