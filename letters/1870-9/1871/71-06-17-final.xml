               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>The peculiarity of formation and difference of leaves on one and the same branch has surprised a few of our more intelligent men here, but they even did not know that those leaves are highly odoriferous — The fresh leave when plucket on the mountains and rubbed between your fingers causes an odour so strong as to effect the peculiar prickeling sensation of Ammonia to the nostrils, it is indeed a restorative to the fatigued nerves of the climber.

It appeared to me as if the extraordinary plant was secured on the critical spot by its own glutenous sap rather than by roots and which indeed appear to be few only and of delicate structure</p>
