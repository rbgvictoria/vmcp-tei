See M to J. <space unit="chars" quantity="1"/>Hooker, 29 August 1871 (in this edition as 71-08-29b); the relevant letter from Hooker to M has not been found. Booth and Hooker were anxious that 'in the eyes of the English gardening community this plant must have nothing to do with Kew — else they would make a great noise' (J. Booth to J. Hooker, 26 June 1871 (in this edition as M71-06-26)). Booth felt the need to agree with Hooker about how he would describe the way he came by the plant when he sent a photograph to journal editors; Hooker annotated the request 'Sent to Mr Booth by Dr Mueller, transmitted through Dr Hooker — figured by permission of Mr Booth who supplied photographs' (J. Booth to J. Hooker, 13 July 1871, RBG Kew, Directors' correspondence, vol. 139, f. 61). Booth was prepared to return the <seg style="font-style: italic; ">
                        <name key="Todea">Todea</name>
                     </seg> if Hooker had difficulties, and told Hooker that 'I tell everybody it is a present from Müller and told so in fact to a good many who saw the plant' (J. Booth to J. Hooker, 30 July 1871; RBG Kew, Directors' correspondence, vol. 139, f. 58). Hooker later suggested to Booth that he send reciprocal specimens to M as a way of reinforcing the perception that the <seg style="font-style: italic; ">
                        <name key="Todea">Todea</name>

               </note> and thence to Berlin. It was sent to you, to deal with quite as you pleased and altho' it is larger than the one now at Kew, it may not be much heavier nor really more valuable. And where can it be placed better, than where the worthy Mr Booth desires to locate it? I am sure, we will all be glad to see the big thing stationed in Berlin, but really the credit of presenting it must be with Mr Booth and yourself not with me. </p>
