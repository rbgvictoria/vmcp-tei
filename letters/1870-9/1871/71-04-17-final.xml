In 1862 Leichhardt's two horses were found near the Flinders, and his supposed marked tree there. This gave rise to the Ladies' Expedition; and I hold that no man, whoever he may be, had a right to discourage the search until the actual remains of the party were found. In this view I am supported by the humanity of the whole world. I believe that the ladies can even take credit to themselves of having through me urged to some measure the expediency of sending out after the 'straggling long-bearded white man,' who, so several newspapers told us, was wandering west of the Thomson River, and that thus, to say the least, an additional impulse was given to the sending of Mr. Gilmour, who, in an extremely favorable season for water, accomplished his task with so much credit.<note xml:id="ftn4" type="footnote" n="4">

               </note> The editor of the <seg style="font-style: italic; ">Courier</seg> is probably not aware that a Bristol lady (a Mrs Robertson) has continued writing year after year to the Ladles' Committee to urge the continuation of the search after Leichhardt's party, because she hoped to see yet again a brother, who accompanied Leichhardt in his last disastrous expedition. But I wish on this occasion to defend the measures of the ladies in sending their expedition.</p>

M'Intyre mapped carefully as much of Queensland on his track as the length of the kingdom of Italy or that of Sweden would be. This ought to be well known to anybody in Brisbane. Besides, the money raised in Victoria was mainly spent in Queensland; indeed, altogether, nearly £4000 were disbursed. Your colony has had ample recompense and benefits of the Ladies' Expedition.</p>
