My department is not endowed to send a collector, and even he would require local help from amateurs simultaneously in each district. Could anything be done by a small premium to schools? I would be quite willing to pay for collections made at the different schools by the children at a moderate prize by way of premium or reward, at a rate fixed for each 100 different species properly dried. If duplicates were retained, I could furnish, for instruction's sake, the names; and the likelihood of sending the same plant over and over again would be avoided. Would your Government School Board or Education Board initiate this system of imparting knowledge? In such a case, what would be an adequate price or prize, and how would the parcels get to K. G. Sound? Would the post take them? Each specimen should have a piece. of paper with it on which the locality, date of collecting. and name of collector, should be noted.</seg>
