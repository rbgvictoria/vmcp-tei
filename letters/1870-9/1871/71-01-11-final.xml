               </note> in which you make such a noble appeal for the support of missionary labours in New Guinea. I feel convinced that by some well organised effort a large sum might be raised in the Australian Colonies for sending the harbingers of Christianity &amp; civilization into a land larger than the United Kingdom of Britain in Europe. In one respect you may take a still more cheerful view of this immense new field for Missionary exertions — I allude to the climate. Unquestionably parts of the coast tracts of New Guinea are insalubrious, but others, open and near the snowy mountains will likely be very salubrious; especially if elevated localities for missionary settlement are sought.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>Allow me also to remark that any mission locality is certain to receive additional support through the stay of naturalists; as not only geographers are anxious to carry from some settled point further enquiries into the large island, but as also Zoologists &amp; botanists are most eager to become acquainted with the living natural products of N. Guinea. The Alps of this island are near the coast, &amp; it might perhaps be so arranged, that through the natives in barter plants &amp; animals might be obtained for our Scientific institutions. I am myself most anxious to acquire collections of dried plants from N. Guinea, particularly from the alpine &amp; other inland localities, for comparison with the plants of the N.E. of Australia; &amp; I should be quite glad to place some fund at the disposal of any New Guinea Missionary with a view of obtaining plants. Others would doubtless similarly support the Mission. In such additional efforts the "Works of God" would be brought also from thence in their glory before us, &amp; new resources be gained for the yet wild barbarians, &amp; additional means afforded for them to settle in peaceful occupations.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>It seems to me a great pity that no system of collecting through missionaries &amp; their congregations is initiated in all the newly occupied spots.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>I may add that whenever a vessel of the missions started from Melbourne, no opportunity was lost by me to send plants of Tea, Coffee, Peru bark and other utilitarian &amp; commercial plants to the missions, &amp; that I always feel a delight if I can thus aid in promoting the welfare of a new Christian settlement.</p>
