                     </seg>. Some days ago that gentleman called at the Crown Lands Office during the sitting of the Board of Land and Works and stated that, having seen in the public papers that many hundreds of Goldfish had been stolen from the ponds in the Treasury Reserve he would supply some for the empty ponds from a pool which he was about to clean out on the Govt House Reserve. He was thanked for the offer — and on Saturday evening <seg style="">
                        <hi rend="underline">after dark</hi>
                     </seg> I received a message from Mr Ferguson that some fish had been caught and <seg style="">
                        <hi rend="underline">were waiting for removal</hi>
                     </seg> at [Brandeth's] ferry. I exceedingly regret the acceptance of these fish as such acceptance has caused annoyance to Dr Von Mueller. I attach little value to the fish as they are so very inferior to those in Fitzroy Garden, (which are the progeny of some given to me by the Acclimatization Society); For those received from Mr Ferguson are all black with one solitary exception'. M asked on 3 March: 'I should regard it as an act of consideration to me as Director of the botanic Garden, if the Assistant Commissioner of Lands will not allow the Forest Inspector to enter into any direct communication with the Lands department on any subject concerning matters in my Department'. Hodgkinson 'noted' the request on the same day.</p>
