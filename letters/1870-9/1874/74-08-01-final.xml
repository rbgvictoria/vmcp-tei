From the full information now afforded you will be pleased to observe that irrespective of my moderate income as a first class officer in professional service, the total of the proposed ordinary working expenses, is reduced to about £1000, therefore to far less than those of any other similar department in the service of this colony, while not even buildings for the advantageous performance of my works are provided, only the Museum room, in reality but a storeroom of the dried plants, and not furnished even with a fireplace, being available. I have therefore to add a solicitation that in justice provision may also be made for a new office building, in which I can properly work with microscopes and other instruments, and where the necessary library space is provided, either by rent or otherwise, the office rent having also during the last 13 months fallen on my private resources now reduced (after the sacrifice of all my private property in the service) to a salary smaller than that of any other professional head of a department. It is also right for me to point out to you, as the hon. minister of the department, that since 15 years no means have been available to extend the Museum building, and that the precious collections, accumulated, under my exertions, and largely inaccessible for want of space and accommodation.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>It remains also my duty to draw your favorable consideration to the circumstance that for the last 4 years no remittance could be made to Dr. W. Sonder of Hamburg, from whom I expected to secure successively his valuable collections as additional aid for my researches by yearly instalments of payment, only our remittance of £120.- for one tenth of the collection having as yet been made through the Agent General. In order that faith may be kept with this illustrious man in the arrangement to locate here finally his collections, secured at great cost by him and with life-long toil, I beg leave to recommend that as a not recurring expense the sum of £880 may also be provided, by which the purchase would at once be completed. Dr. Sonder, at the recent scientific congress of Florence, had to decline the offer of £1000.- for his herbarium, which was to be secured for a leading scientific institution of Europe, simply because part of the collection having been forwarded already by sale to the Victorian Government and being incorporated already in our state collections here.</p>
