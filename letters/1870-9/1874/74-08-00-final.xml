That the ordinary correspondence should be so extensive cannot be surprising when it is considered that the vegetation merely of Australia consists of about 11,000 species of plants (the minutest fungi, Desmidiaceae and Diatomeae uncounted), that not only on any of these the most varied enquiry arises, but that in like manner information is also expected at any time on any extra-Australian plants, numbering already about 120,000 species (their varieties not even considered). It is also easily understood how increasing demand here for information manifests itself on these almost numberless indigenous and foreign plants, all of which, in the great household of nature, have their assigned uses, though as yet their value may be largely buried in obscurity, and can be rendered only more fully known by the progressive strides of science. But, with the augmented calls for information arising in an increasing community, enlarged means for extended research and wider diffusion of knowledge become needful. It is almost unnecessary to add that, so far as the absence of any kind of office accommodation admitted of it, daily advice and explanations have been afforded.</p>

               </note> in the elaboration of which I am engaged with Mr. Bentham in London, who is the principal author of the work, but whose main material is obtained from our museum collections and from the notes which accompany them. These collections were commenced by me in Australia already in 1847, and their augmentation has continued uninterruptedly ever since. The supply of copies of the new volume alluded to has been duly received from the Agent-General so far as the Victorian Government is entitled, and a number of the copies have been distributed to public institutions. During the year my own preliminary labors for the seventh volume have been continued, comprising connected researches on the Grasses of Australia, of which we possess, according to our collections, about 250 species; further, on Rushes, Sedges and allied plants (the difficult order of Restiaceae, numbering alone about 70 species), on Najadeae and cognate groups, on Palms and various other monocotyledonous plants, the Cyperaceae alone remaining yet to be finally examined here for the seventh volume, since the Liliaceae and cognate plants, as well as all the Ferns, have undergone already previously my local scrutiny. The vast material accumulated under my hands for arrangement has enabled me to assign to numerous genera, species and varieties now at last a settled systematic position, involving unavoidable and extensive changes in previous appellations, as reference to my recent writings on grasses and some other orders of plants will amply testify.Nor should be lost sight of the fact, in estimating the task involved, that the grasses of Victoria, or indeed any other of our plants, could only be systematically elaborated in conjunction with those of any other part of Australia, and that again the Australian species, as a whole, could not be properly and permanently defined except in comparison with those of all other parts of the globe. Most likely the seventh volume of the <seg style="font-style: italic; ">Australian Flora</seg> will appear in 1875; but it requires to be followed by a supplemental volume on the cotyledonar plants, for which my manuscripts and notes are largely prepared; then, subsequently, will also be due two volumes on Mosses, Lichens, Algae and Fungi, for the elaboration of which, however, even the continued sacrifice of a considerable share of my yearly official income would not provide all the needful books, journals and instruments.<note xml:id="ftn4" type="footnote" n="4">

Thus, the acids of our Casuarinas (in this instance of C. quadrivalvis) were subjected to analysis, and the presence of citric acid, accompanied by two other organic acids, was shown in the foliage of these trees. As usual, numerous investigations of these kinds gave negative results. The percentage of the volatile oil in the foliage of Melaleuca hypericifolia, M. decussata, Callistemon rigidus, C. rugulosus, Agonis flexuosa, Eucalyptus cornuta, E. colossea, E. populnea, E. calophylla, E. nutans, though known to be small, was also ascertained, while I was commencing to study the physical and technological properties of each.

In the search for salep in the tubers of our terrestrial Orchideae the common Microtis porrifolia gave the best, indeed highly satisfactory, results. In drying, the roots of this species evolve a slight violet odor, and ten grains of the dry powder produces one ounce of good pale mucilage, free of bitterness. The tubers of Thelymitra aristata, although still richer in mucilage, are slightly bitter and of brownish tinge. As yet, but few of the numerous Orchids of Victoria are examined in this respect, as these tests came to a perfect close; but the few kinds of Pterostylis tubers experimented on proved inferior to those of Microtis.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>The persevering ingenuity and the intelligent application of capital of one gentleman, Joseph Bosisto, Esq., of Richmond, have raised the production of various kinds of Eucalyptus oil to a flourishing industry, though in first instance indicated or called forth by the labors of my own department. So we have other mercantile commodities, the value of which I foresaw, and the recognition of which, here and abroad, I always aided, not only by departmental but also unofficial efforts. Thus it was in the Botanic Garden of Melbourne, and there only, where Mons. Ramel became, twenty years ago, first acquainted with the Eucalyptus globulus, and where this enlightened and patriotic gentleman could recognise its celerity of growth and its resistance to dry heat, the quality of its timber being then already known. Hence arose, for many years under almost my sole aid, M. Ramel's introduction of this tree and several other Eucalypts to South France and Algeria, while by unceasing efforts on my part, under much discouragement and adversity, I endeavoured to do my public duty also in this direction towards my adopted country, by finding for the Eucalypts, first of all in numerous species (140 now being known, irrespective of what may exist in Eastern New Guinea), a place in many countries of both hemispheres. The medicinal experiments, especially as regards the value of these trees, through therapeutic and climatic action, in intermittent fevers, their antiseptic properties and other qualities for hygienic purposes, were instituted in fever regions of various parts of South Europe and South America, of which we are happily almost free; and this mainly on material from trees, for the early introduction of which into these countries I was instrumental myself while performing the duties of my office, or while promoting scientific research out of private and but slender means. Exertions like these have much brought about the extensive exports of Eucalyptus seeds, increasing from year to year, to any places of the world free of severe frosts and free of intense damp heat; the way for this, like in other instances, was paved by extensive correspondence in several languages, by manifold literary writings, by active co-operation in exhibitions, ever since 1854, by interchanges for test culture, by oral explanations of almost daily occurrence, and finally by unsparing application of any private resources of my own. In the benefits, which hence have arisen to us here, also the surrounding colonies have long since participated. Our Industrial City-Museum contains samples of many technologic products furnished by my department, such as new and various paper material, fibres, fixed and distilled oils, native potash, soda, dyes, tars, acetic wood acid, wood alcohol, bromine, iodine and many other substances from native material, still lying latent, though extant in boundless quantity; yet, as may be imagined, all these exhibit only very fragmentary the resources of our indigenous vegetable wealth, not to speak of the commercial and industrial articles which can be obtained, either by direct yield or by the application of chemical or industrial processes, from the almost endless number of foreign plants calculated to prosper under the Australian sky. In order, therefore, to enable me to resume my labors also in this direction, I would respectfully recommend, as one of the needful measures, that my laboratory, with all its appliances, together with its former modest working vote, be restored to my use, and that the simple analyses of soil, lately — so I understand — performed there, may be carried out at a convenient closeness to the department, to which this particular branch of the public service belongs, and in a special structure for that purpose, which need not be expensive.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>From the 11th to the 17th December I was engaged in various observations on the plants in the forest regions of the Upper Yarra and the southern branches of the Goulburn River, adding to my definitions and localities of the plants of Victoria, and obtaining some species of leading interest for the "educational collections." In these sylvan tracts I also instituted various measurements of the heights of Eucalyptus amygdalina (var. regnans), so far as my brief stay admitted, the greatest heights obtained being approximately 400 feet. To some apparently higher trees I could not obtain access during my short stay and with the means at my command, as the dense jungle would require to be cleared for a base line. It is my intention to resume these investigations at an early date, with the prospect of renewed support in the commenced new financial year. The magnificent Festuca dives, discovered by me in West Gippsland during my travels in 1860, was now ascertained to have a wide range through the forests towards the Yarra and Goulburn sources, where, among grasses, it forms a most stately object, the height of twelve feet being not unusual, while occasionally this superb grass in the ferntree gullies, on rivulets, attains in rich soil to seventeen feet. Among grasses, fit to live under the shade of trees, it becomes for humid localities one of the most eligible; for although the broad foliage is somewhat coarse, yet the panicle of seeds is very ample and nutritious. This Festuca is one of the most desirable for scenic group planting in horticulture. Mr. C. Walter, to whose disinterested zeal the field service of my institution owes so much, was in this short journey part of the time my companion. The completion of the railway line to Wodonga afforded an easy opportunity for approach to the Hume River district, which was left by me untraversed, when in 1854 I forced, as a pioneer, my way through the whole length of the Mitta-mitta country (then ascending, naming, and measuring Mount Hotham and other alpine heights), and when in 1855 I approached and traversed our north-eastern high alps from the Snowy River. With the utterly reduced means of my department this new journey through a large, and by me hitherto entirely unexplored district, could not have been carried out even in its hurried course, had it not been for the generosity of the settlers on the line of my travels, among whom I should especially mention James Findlay, Esq., of Towang,<note xml:id="ftn17" type="footnote" n="17">

Once mounted, the summits of the alps are traversable for many miles without much impediment, the whole terminal portions, from 6,000 to 7,000 feet elevation, being above the region of trees and even shrubs, open therefore in all directions; while a second spring can be enjoyed by the visitor here long after the spring flowers of the lowlands have passed away. The variety of the plants, peculiar to these alpine heights is most charming, about one hundred species being restricted to elevations, on which snow falls during the greater part of the year.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>It would lead too far to enter in this document on any details of the vegetation of the Hume River country, as, moreover, the special phytographic observations find best their place in the works specially designed for the purpose. But I would wish to allude here to an important horticultural acquisition, which emanated from this journey, namely, a crimson variety of the almost arborescent Correa Lawrenciana of Sir William Hooker, which variety was never seen before, combining all the brilliancy of the flowers of C. speciosa with a hardy endurance to a cold clime, with very tall and stately growth, and with a shining lustre of large leaves. An entirely new tree, probably of medicinal value, the Bertya Findlayi, was also discovered; while several Eucalypts of New South Wales were noticed, which seem not to occur in other parts of our colony. The Tasmanian sassafras tree, pepper tree and bluegum tree, with many other southern forms of vegetation, were traced for the first time so far north, and really into the territory of New South Wales. The elevations to which numerous lowland plants ascend into the snowy ranges was also determined on this occasion. An Italian, Casparo Mussio, who accompanied me through Mr. Findlay's kindness, and was familiar with many parts of these alps, proved an able companion. To do, however, justice to the task of examining the vegetation of so wide a tract of country closely — most parts of which as yet uninhabited and naturally of difficult access — it would be needful to devote many months specially for the purpose of penetrating through many of the mountain recesses, and of watching the numerous different plants throughout the season. Cursorily as this first journey necessarily was, which occupied my time from the 6th to the 26th January, it leaves, at all events, the vegetation of the Hume River district no longer unrepresented in our collections.</p>

               </note> Wolffia, of the occurrence of which in any part of Australia we were not previously aware. From the 26th of February till the 10th of March I proceeded through the ranges and heaths west of Cape Otway, the whole of the country in that direction having been beyond my reach, when, in 1857, the dense forests towards Apollo Bay and thence to Cape Otway came within the scope of my phytologic explorations. The very tall but extremely slender tree fern, Cyathea medullaris, first found by Mr. Wilkinson during his partial geologic survey of these regions, seems not to extend so far west as my journey through the coast tracts carried me; but several other ferns of great rarity were observed in the deep, dark and ever humid glens, and the areal extent of many species of plants, the changes of their varieties, and their relation to geological and climatic conditions was traced to the rivers Curdie and Gellibrand. In this part of my recent travels I experienced most liberal aid from Dr. Curdie, M.A., J.P., of Tondarook, and from Messrs. Oliver of the Gellibrand River. An important work, in which the department has shared during the year, consists in the elucidation of the plants of Lord Howe's Island, largely accessible to us through the disinterested stay of Mr. Fullagar (accompanied by Mr. Lind) for nearly a year on this very isolated and phyto-geographically highly remarkable oceanic spot.<note xml:id="ftn20" type="footnote" n="20">

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>Lastly, it remains for me to refer to the issue of the educational collections as an additional engagement initiated in the departmental service. I had long in contemplation to arouse a more general and popular interest in the native vegetation surrounding us by choosing some means, for instilling the very first instructions, more inviting than the use of text-books, and more fascinating than scholastic lectures. Though my aims were also — and not unsuccessfully so — in this direction, by securing and arranging methodically the plants in growth at the Botanic Gardens until that work became impaired, and finally impeded, if not even largely destroyed; yet I felt that an impetus should be given to the study, especially of native plants, at any place also far beyond the reach of gardens of instruction, and to any one, who might hesitate to address me in correspondence, however cheerfully I have named plants, and explained their scientific and utilitarian bearings almost daily during these twenty years and more. To lead, therefore, by some more direct and universal action the attention of the now numerous inhabitants of our colony to a more scientific contemplation of the plants which, in our winterless zone, present themselves successively throughout the year to our views, I required to furnish starting points on many places for local studies. This design I hoped most pleasingly and lastingly to attain by commencing the "educational collections," to be located in the rooms of such public institutions as during the ordinary hours of recreation and leisure are accessible. Each fascicle is to contain fifty species of natural specimens, in a pressed and dried state, and is to exhibit as many representative forms of genera and orders as conveniently at any particular period of issue can be gathered, and each species is to be accompanied by annotations on its scientific name, its English appellation (if such in rare instances exists), its geographic limits, and some of its literature.<note xml:id="ftn21" type="footnote" n="21">

               </note> By adopting such a plan I could bring a number of typical forms of plants for independent identification or comparison of the plants of any district before the views of local observers, who could not fail to recognise from the indications thus offered, at once a multitude of plants, whether specifically or generically, at the very vicinity of their habitations. The first fascicle now contains representations of fifty genera, and nearly as many natural orders. The present edition, for mere want of financial support to my department, was limited to 100 copies, involving nevertheless the drying of about 10,000 specimens, inasmuch as each species had to be exhibited not only in flower, but in fruit also. This edition can be extended according to the means available, at any season for collecting and drying purposes, and for obtaining the necessary paper and board-covers. On the extent of these means must also depend the more or less rapid or tardy issue of subsequent fascicles. The two assistants of the department, Mr. G. Luehmann and Mr. C. Groener, deserve praise for having given up much of their time on holidays, and at early and late hours, to obtain and prepare a large share of the plants for the 100 copies of this first fascicle. In the embarrassed state of the department, also, this work had to be carried on under great disadvantage, because not even a single packing or drying room is left me, the only building space remaining at my disposal for the whole departmental work in every branch being the Museum room, which is overcrowded by the normal collections, and to which no building additions have been made during the last sixteen years, notwithstanding repeated solicitations.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>Thus the process of drying plants for any of our departmental purposes has to be carried out in the Museum room itself, while thereby the safety of the normal collection became and still becomes endangered through the invasion of insects from freshly gathered plants. The irreparable injury, to which thus the Museum plants are exposed, may at any time befall not only plants gathered since the last thirty-five years by myself, but also specimens even from still remoter times, which out of the hands of celebrated authors and travellers passed early into my care. A valuable chemical auxiliary for maintaining our Museum plants in preservation we have found in the bisulphid of carbon, applied according to M. Lénormand's method, as recommended in the <seg style="font-style: italic; ">Bulletin de la Société Botanique de France,</seg> 1858.<note xml:id="ftn22" type="footnote" n="22">

               </note> In connection with this subject, it remains for me yet to bring under your favorable notice, that although the collections of Australian plants in our Museum are by far the largest in the world, yet the extra-Australian section of the Museum should be widely extended. To attain this object speedily and advantageously a double measure is recommendable: First, the maintenance (as in former years) of a field collector in localities yet rich in new plants, with a view of affording us not solely some direct additions to our own Museum treasures, but, furthermore, also the means for interchanges, without which no continuous access to plants of value and novelty can be obtained from institutions of kindred tendency abroad; nor could we keep pace with them in our own progressive study. The second measure would be to secure by purchase an extensive collection of extra-Australian museum plants, rich in authentic specimens of those writers, who issued their phytographic works in the earlier parts of this century, in order to enable us here, for all times, to institute independent critical comparison, and to give us the best of basis to work on for the identification and classification of any plant of the globe.<note xml:id="ftn23" type="footnote" n="23">

               </note> The acquisition of such a collection would long since have been realized out of my private resources, had they not been absorbed in the struggle through years of maintaining a department, created by myself, in its lasting efficiency and scientific dignity; while the addition of large extra-Australian collections of authoritative importance to the great treasures here already accumulated would render our phytologic Museum one of the most important of the globe, and would confer benefits and facilities on the scientific service of this colony for all future generations.</p>
