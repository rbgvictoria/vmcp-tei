               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>The marvellous rapidity of growth of this tree among evergreen and hard wooded kinds (equalling or even excelling the rate of growth of a poplar or a willow) combined with the enormous size of the tree, could not fail to attract early attention, as well in Tasmania as in Victoria, to which two colonies the <name key="Eucalyptus%20globulus">Eucalyptus globulus</name> is naturally almost confined. Among the first, who planted it extensively in Victoria was the late General Sir Edward Macarthur; this was fully 20 years ago, and some plantations in Tasmania were formed still earlier. Having had myself an opportunity as far back as 1852 &amp; 1853 to watch our Blue-Gum-trees in the forests of Mount Macedon, Dandenong, Mount Buller, the Buffalo Ranges and in many parts of Gippsland, and having also seen with what facility they could be raised by sowings of seeds obtained then for the Melbourne Botanic Garden, and having also noticed the resistance of the tree to drought, with others I recognized the importance of this valuable gift to us by nature for transferring it in masses to woodless countries in warm temperate climes.</p>

A gradually increasing demand for seeds arose, and it is no exaggeration when I affirm, that seed-merchants and seed collectors have exported hitherto to the value of £10,000 of seeds of our Blue Gum trees, not to speak of the seeds of other Eucalypts; the rate of export is still increasing, a large quantity having been demanded also for New Zealand since a series of years.

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>Among nearly 150 species of Eucalyptus known to exist in Australia the <name key="Eucalyptus%20globulus">Eucalyptus globulus</name> is chiefly recognized by the quadrangular stem and the clasping broad opposite and ashy-blue leaves of the young plants, by the sessile often solitary flowers, covered with a crown-shaped somewhat chalky lid, and by the peculiar shape and comparatively large size of its fruit-capsules. All further characteristics are clearly set forth in the works already quoted. The vernacular appellation Blue Gum tree is an ambiguous one, in as much as in New South Wales and South Queensland several other species occur under the name of Blue Gum trees (Euc. eugenioides, E. haemastoma, E. botryoides, E. tereticornis), while in some parts of our own colony a very different tree namely my E. goniocalyx passes under the same popular appellation, and while in West Australia my Euc. diversicolor and E. megacarpa are called Blue Gum trees.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>The natural growth of the Eucalypts is often very close in the forests, sometimes from 20 to 40 large trees occur on an acre; but in proportion to their closeness they are also more slender. This shows however how large a yield of timber might thus be obtained from forest areas, either natural or artificial, if carefully worked. In our own western basaltic plains and undulations, which are extensively destitute of timber, enlightened settlers, in forming areas of trees, have predominantly and very successfully chosen the E. globulus for this purpose. In reference to the celerity of growth of this tree under very favorable circumstances we are made aware of some astounding data. <space unit="chars" quantity="1"/>So I was informed by Mr. Brace, that in the Neilgherries<note xml:id="ftn15" type="footnote" n="15">

Even in the comparatively cool clime of Hyéres in France the height attained in eight years was 55 feet. In rich deep soil the same results may here be obtained. The Euc. globulus is not absolutely bound to any geologic formation; but it has a predilection in culture for friable soil of fair quality, and dislikes much stagnant water in the soil, also avoids pure sand and saline ground. Young plants while yet succulent are apt to be attacked by a species of coccus, also by caterpillars of various kinds. In Senegambia, while the locusts destroyed the bark of nearly all other trees, they left the Eucalyptus untouched. </p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>Turning briefly to some of the products, obtainable from <name key="Eucalyptus%20globulus">Eucalyptus globulus</name>, the volatile oil directly yielded by distillation from the foliage, may first be mentioned. The yield is from ⅔ to 1 percent; hence this Eucalyptus is thus far outrivalled by several species, for instance E. amygdalina, E oleosa and some others. The oil of Eucalyptus was brought by me before the first Paris exhibition in 1855, with the view of its adoption in medicine, its resemblance to the Indian oil of Cajput having then become to me very obvious. Mr. Jos. Bosisto of Richmond prepared the oil on that occasion for me and the same Gentleman and Mr. W. Johnson of St. Kilda furnished a whole series of oils from materials supplied by myself on the occasion of the Melbourne exhibition of 1862 and the London exhibition of 1863. Again in 1866 for the intercolonial exhibition and in 1867 for the second Paris exhibition the Eucalyptus oil was produced in a laboratory then recently established in my department, and its qualities carefully investigated on suggestions of myself by Mr. J. Osborne, the discoverer of photo-lithography. Mr. Jos. Bosisto also carried on then extensive tests of the qualities of the oil, and he has the credit of having pushed it into mercantile trade and extensive technologic application, after the value of the oil as an admixture to precious cosmetics in the manufacture of scented soaps and its great utility as a solvent of select resins for superior varnishes had been recognized, partly by himself partly by other investigators. The remarkable fact was then demonstrated of this oil dissolving subterranean Kauri and Amber. 100 parts of the oil of <name key="Eucalyptus%20globulus">Eucalyptus globulus</name> are saturated with 14 parts of Camphor, 12 parts of Mastic, 7 parts of Janderac 8 parts of Kauri resin, 6 parts of Asphalt. It mixes in all proportions with oil of turpentine, all fat and drying oils, benzole, naphtha, ether and pure alcohol. Its specific weight is 0.917. It boils at from 338 - 347° F., passing off Eucalyptol, first prepared by Dr. Cloëz of Paris, who found for this the chemical formula C<seg style="font-size: 10pt; ">24</seg>H<seg style="font-size: 10pt; ">20</seg>O<seg style="font-size: 10pt; ">2</seg>. The remaining volatile oil boils between 370 and 374° F. Mr. Cloëz obtained from Eucalyptol by application of phosphoric acid the new Eucalyptene and Eucalyptolene. Eucalyptus oil can be used for giving light quite like Kerosene, the best of which it surpasses by its more pleasant odor. In burning it leaves no smoke and does not explode. The trade in Eucalyptus oil, hitherto exported solely from Victoria, as a new resource of the colony represents by this time several or perhaps many thousand pounds, and the demand in the European and American markets will be likely increasing. It is most cheaply driven off from the leaves by steam vapor. </p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>But this is not the only oil obtainable from the Blue Gum tree. In my laboratory I caused tar to be prepared from Blue Gum wood by Mr. Rummel, and this tar subjected to analysis to trace its component parts. The pitch obtained was excellent and can be dissolved for varnishes and be used in other ways technologically. The tar itself, which can be produced cheaply by thousands of tons from waste wood, now lost, will doubtless ere long become an article of export when the supply of wood tar from North Europe and North America fails. The process of its production presents no difficulty, involves no large outlay and requires no trained knowledge of any extent. Dyes of various kinds could likely be obtained from the Eucalyptus tar, but my intended investigations in this direction could with the withdrawal of the necessary working votes and the laboratory not be carried out. <space unit="chars" quantity="1"/>

When planted in masses on malarian swamps very beneficial effects from Eucalypts seem to have arisen, which may be attributed to a threefold action, namely the drying of swampy ground, through the enormous power of absorption and respiration possessed by Eucalypts in a much higher degree than most other trees (as explained in my lecture on forest conservation and wood industries printed nearly three years ago), secondly the diffusion of antimiasmatic vapour of the volatile Eucalyptus oil through the air; thirdly the antiseptic action of the dropping Eucalyptus leaves on other vegetable and also animal substances decaying on the ground, or contained in water near it. </p>

Gubler (1871), p. 154, cites this work as 'présenté à la Société d'agriculture d'Alger, 1869', but it was published in Ajaccio, Corsica. As in his text Gubler notes that Carlotti was from Ajaccio, his footnote giving Algiers as the place of presentation may have been a mistake. Carlotti, p. 18, quotes a passage from a letter from Tedeschi to him describing those who doubt the efficacy of <seg style="font-style: italic; ">Eucalyptus</seg> as disciples of St Thomas, a passage quoted by Gubler, p. 154.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>The aqueous or vineous infusion, retaining the volatile oil, seems the best form of administration, as the leaves contain no alkaloids and therefore the medicinal properties must rest on the better extractive principle, some resin, the essential oil and perhaps the tannic acid, of the leaves. The leaves can also be administered in the form of powder. In many cases simply the Eucalyptol has been used for various medical purposes. It is particularly in intermittent fevers, in which the Eucalyptus medicines have been administered, and particularly in such cases in which the unsuccessful use of Quinine indicated the trial of some of the various other known febrifugal remedies and among these now, according to the testimony of several physicians in various parts of the globe, Eucalyptus takes a high rank. <space unit="chars" quantity="1"/>The treatment with Eucalyptus has overcome in many cases long standing febrile affections. Special physiologic and therapeutic experiments, made by Dr. Claude Bernard, Professor Robin and Dr. Vulpian, have shown that the Eucalyptol diminishes the spinal reflex action, lessens organic combustion and also respiration, facilitates the elimination of urea, stimulates the sympathetic nerves and the capillary circulation, and is eliminated again by the lungs and bladder.<note xml:id="ftn26" type="footnote" n="26">

In cholera, the inclination to vomit is diminished by this remedy and the infusoria are destroyed. Against inflammation of and probably any fungus vegetation the mucous membranes generally it has proved most useful. Dr. Gimbert finds the Eucalyptol as an antiseptic most advantageously applicable as an external remedy in putrid suppurations. Injected into the veins of an animal it retards the decomposition of the cadaver for a long time, differing in this respect from the oil of turpentine, which exercises only a passing preservative effect. The coagulated blood of rabbits was preserved for three months after an injection of Eucalyptol without perceptible alteration; the tissues dried up and exhaled the odour of Eucalypts.</p>

In this colony many of these observations of Spanish and French physicians have been verified, and I may add that the distilled oil of Eucalyptus leaves has proved here the most quickly acting remedy for healing the sores of horses. Dr. Brunel in Montevideo had patients coming from Brazil and West Africa, to obtain relief from fever by the Eucalyptus treatment, and has published a treatise on his clinical observations respecting the use of this plant.<note xml:id="ftn29" type="footnote" n="29">

These proportions are however not absolute, as they depend on the nature of the particular quality and age of the wood, and on the degree of heat adopted; for it was ascertained in the progress of similar enquiries by Mr. Rummel in my laboratory, that with at once increased heat a larger volume of light-gas is evolved, at the expense of the other products, a discovery which promises to lead to extensive application of wood instead of coal in any gasworks.</p>
