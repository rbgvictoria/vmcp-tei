Under the heading 'BOTANICAL WORKS published, or preparing for publication at the Herbarium', Hooker wrote: '"Flora of Australia," Vol. VII., by G. Bentham and Baron Von Mueller. (Another volume will complete this work.)'. M correctly interpreted this statement as implying that volume VII would be the last.</p>
               </note> the remark, that the 7th vol. would close the work; so it may be for Europe and your noble action; but as the first volume is already a dozen years old and others are also published years ago necessarily large supplements to the work must appear, though perhaps under a changed title, yet a continuation of the work. Dr Hooker did perhaps not think, that even so small a remark might hurt me in the progress of my labor, while everything should be done by colleagues or former colleagues to give me their moral support, for building up again my position. You yourself desired me to supplement the work. So I shall endeavour to do <seg style="">
