                     <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>The Shire Council of Corio at a meeting held in August had their attention drawn to the fact that several head of cattle had died on the common from the effects of what was believed to be a poisonous plant. The Council resolved that a specimen of the plant should be sent to Dr. Mueller, Government Botanist, with the view of ascertaining the name and nature of the plant in question. Dr. Mueller's reply, which was sent immediately on receipt of the letter, was read at the meeting of the Council yesterday, and as other districts may have the plant growing now or at some future time, we subjoin his remarks for general information. The members of the Council were much pleased at Dr Mueller's promptitude in replying.</p>

               </note> The action of these plants is inflammatory in the mucus membranes of the digestive organs, and even corrosively so if the plant has been consumed in large quantity, and in all likelihood the absorption of the poison into the circulation would also change the normal condition of the blood.

To cause such patches of land to be ploughed on which these noxious herbs exist, and to get the ground thus broken up, well sown with perennial grasses, clover, lucerne, sanfoin, and any other nutritive pasture plants by which means the copious re appearance of the drosera would be rendered almost impossible. The quickness of the growth of such pasture plants should be aided by a copious application of any kind of manure rich in lime, potash and phosphorus acids.

The herdsman, allow me to suggest, might keep off the animals from the worst spots of drosera growth until the plant is removed. It shrivels up in the summer heat, but will re-appear next spring from its small tuberous root unless the means suggested above are adopted. </p>
