                     <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>James Casey (Chief Secretary) had written to Barry on 18 May 1874 (UM312 Registrar's correspondence, 1874/19 Grounds, University of Melbourne Archives, Melbourne) saying that 'There will be a vote on the estimates (I hope) for the erection of a Botanical museum in the University Grounds. And it is proposed to transfer the admirable &amp; valuable collection gathered by Baron Von Mueller to the new building'. This may have led to the assumption that M was to be transferred to the University staff or be required to lecture. No direct evidence of such a proposal has been found. The proposal to transfer the herbarium did not proceed: see R. Barry to M, 10 December 1874.</p>
               </note> This took me by surprise; for not only have I never been asked, whether I was willing to accept such a position, but more I have always stated with distinctness that I would decline it, even if offered.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>It has however been the custom since years to dispose of me without consulting my own views, and it might therefore happen, that such a position was to be a compulsory addition to my office of Governm. Botanist. With all my best wishes for the University, in which you take such a deep interest, I would ask of you the great kindness to inform the Council, that under no circumstance I should add to my duties those of any University position. This resolution is unalterable. You, my dear Doctor, are well aware, that chronic bronchial irritation renders me quite unfit to lecture with regularity, and when I occasionally gave a lecture at the industrial museum or elsewhere, it was under great distress. A position as University teacher was offered me when I was but 21 years of age,<note xml:id="ftn4" type="footnote" n="4">

Moreover the University is ably provided in all, that concerns the teaching of plants by Prof. M'Coy and Dr Bird, and in the event of additional lecturing being needed, it would be found, that more than one man would be got able to enter on such additional duties.</p>
