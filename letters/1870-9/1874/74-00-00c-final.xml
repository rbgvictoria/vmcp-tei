The article begins as follows: ‘This does not seem to be so well known as it deserves to be, from the fact of its not often being seen in gardens. It is undoubtedly a very wholesome and palatable vegetable, and from its being a perennial should be a very profitable and substantial addition to our gardens.

The <name key="Chenopodium">Chenopodium</name> is very palatable and wholesome, and remarkable also as a perennial plant among allied species. It grows taller than most kinds of <name key="Chenopodium">Chenopodium</name>. In England it would succumb down to the root in winter, but likely spring again with the return of warm weather from the root. On early sowing it would likely produce seeds in the first autumn. The plant is more like Spinach in a boiled state. </p>
