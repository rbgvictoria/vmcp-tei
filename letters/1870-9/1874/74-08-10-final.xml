                     xml:lang="en">Krichauff was the instigator of SA's Forest Trees Planting Encouragement Act to encourage the planting of trees by private persons, the final parliamentary stages being completed on 17 December 1873. However, no regulations were framed nor were districts in which it would operate gazetted. Krichauff introduced a second Bill, to establish a Forest Board 'to give effect to' the earlier Act, with other wider powers. Krichauff quoted from Vogel's speech when moving the second reading of the new Bill on 26 August 1874 (<seg style="font-style: italic; ">South Australian register</seg>, 27 August 1864, p. 6). The Bill had not completed its Parliamentary passage by the end of the session, and therefore lapsed. A similar Bill was introduced in the next session and passed, with the first Board being appointed in November (<seg style="font-style: italic; ">South Australian register</seg>, 13 November 1875, p. 7, reprinting the notice from the SA <seg style="font-style: italic; ">Government gazette, </seg>11 November 1875). </p>

I gladly give the gratuitous consent to it; the 3 portions could be alphabetically rearranged and a new grouping be made as a key to the whole. I could give some additional (as yet unpublished) notes together with a geographic index, which is ready. As the clime of Victoria is so nearly alike to that of N.Z., these lists of plants, republished in N. America and New South Wales also already, of popular construction, would serve also your community. I was under the impression, that I had given the hon.

Cooper, on 16 September noting: 'I think a reprint of Baron Von Muellers paper would be very useful in this Colony — […] is much asked for &amp; I have lost the […] of my copy.' On 29 September the Colonial Secretary, D. Pollen, asked Cooper: 'Is there a copy in the library or can one be obtained here — if not the Professor might be asked to be good enough to send one'. Cooper replied on 6 October: 'The learned professor's work is not in the [...] library, nor is it likely that a copy of it can be procured here. As he offers to rearrange the work &amp; give some additional, yet unpublished, notes, I think he sh[ould]d be asked to send over the copy for a new edition, wh[ich] could be brought out at our Printing Office.' Pollen approved this suggestion.</p>
