Dr Bleasdale, who is anxious that I should bring by this months mail (which leaves tomorrow morning) under the notice of the Royal Society a suggestion of his, by which the reverend Gentleman hopes to lessen the numerous catastrophes arising still in coalmines by explosions through the access of flame to air largely mixed with hydrogen or hydrogen and carbon. The great boon of Sir Humphrey Davy's security lamp has given considerable safety against such disasters, but even with the improvements effected on this lamp by Upton, Dumesnil, Roberts, Müseler, Combes, and others,<note xml:id="ftn1" type="footnote" n="1">

               </note> the accidents, have still occasionally ocurred, as we are well aware, one most dreadful and extensive occuring a few years ago in a coal mine of Saxony. This has led the Rev Dr Bleasdale to come forward with his new proposition. Amidst my mail-work I have no time to reflect calmly on this subject in all its bearings, but I gladly respond to the learned divines request of bringing his views at once under notice, and I trust you will allow me with your usual urbanity and constant readiness to aid research to submit Dr Bleasdale's note to yourself, especially as your Colleague Dr Maskelyne would likely be able to test the rev Gentlemans proposition. Prof Nevil Maskelyne has been in correspondence with Dr Bleasdale on mineral gems, on the elucidation of which, so far as Australia is concerned, the latter has spent much attention, and this very successfully too. It will be for your kind consideration, whether the wish of the Rev Doctor, to have his views brought before the Royal Society can be realized with propriety.<note xml:id="ftn2" type="footnote" n="2">
