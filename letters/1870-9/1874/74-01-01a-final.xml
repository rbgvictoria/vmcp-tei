               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>The views, which you now express, concerning yourself and your Directorial position, have taken me very much by surprise. You have only a few months ago manfully struggled, seconded by the thoughtful &amp; persevering efforts of sterling friends, to protect and maintain the <seg style="">
                  <hi rend="underline">integrity</hi>
               </seg> of your Directorial position. And now, my dear Dr Hooker, but a few months afterwards, you express yourself anxious to recede from the Directorate as a whole, and to devote even on half salary your attention exclusively to Museum &amp; literary work. You must allow me in candor to confess, that this expression of yours is an enigma to me, and must be surrounded by collateral condition[s], about which from the distance here I cannot judge.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>In advocating or desiring such a change you are not just to yourself nor to all your great colleagues, none of whom would be rejoicing to see such a precedent set by the greatest of all institutions. I implore you, to make not such sentiments known, if not for your own sake then at least out of consideration of us others. If Mr Michie or any other Victorian or anyone likely to come here or to write here, became acquainted with your sudden change of views, you would give my few antagonists the most powerful weapon to use against me, and you would defy the kind action of a very few friends here, who strenuously operate to see me honorably restored to the integrity of my position. I am sure that one, who like you, has treated me always with so much generous consideration, cannot wish to aid in my permanent ruin, even inconsciously. The life in England must be cheap indeed, if you think you can subsist on half of your modest salary, which — so I saw with delight in "nature" — was to be increased.<note xml:id="ftn2" type="footnote" n="2">

Flower, in a letter published in <seg style="font-style: italic; ">Nature</seg>, 24 July 1873, pp 243-4, wrote that he knew of no position in the biological sciences that provided an income 'sufficient to join freely in intellectual society and to give one's children a good education' unless 'aided by independent means'. No new organization was wanted, but 'in the first place the Government ought at once to increase the pay of all its scientific officers, such as the Astronomer Royal, the Director of Kew Gardens, …'. <space unit="chars" quantity="1"/>No announcement that this suggestion was to be acted upon has been found in <seg style="font-style: italic; ">Nature</seg>, 1873.</p>
