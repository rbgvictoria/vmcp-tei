               </note> Let me congratulate you; it involved exertions to you for the last 15 years which at your venerable age few would have been able to sustain. You must be grateful to providence for allowing you mental strength and the retention of unimpaired eyesight for having been able to study the minutiae of structure of even such plants as the glumaceae extensively, while young workers even often shrink from work of this kind, if to be carried on for lengthened periods.</p>

The votes, squandered in my garden since the last 5 years, are absolutely enormous, but for myself no proper means can be found, perhaps because I am a foreigner here. However Mr Graham Berry, the present Premier, who has treated me at least with consideration and civility has promised to do something towards the resuscitation of my Department, but what it will be &amp; when it will take place is not yet decided; certainly not much. </p>
