                        <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>On 2 March 1878, Forrest forwarded M's letter to the Colonial Secretary, R. Goldsworthy. On 18 March, Giles wrote to the Governor of WA, H. Ord (in this edition as<space unit="chars" quantity="1"/>M78-03-18), supporting M's request, as did Forrest on 4 April to his chief, M. Fraser (in this edition as M78-04-04). On 2 May, despite Fraser's opposing the application on the grounds that it would create a dangerous precedent (see M. Fraser to R. Goldsworthy, 20 April 1878 (in this edition as M78-04-20)), the Governor granted Giles permission to re-select the 2,000 acres to which he was entitled. Six months were allowed<space unit="chars" quantity="1"/>in which to make the selection.</p>

Unknown to M, however, the land in question had been set aside as Commonage; see R. Goldsworthy to M, 26 November 1878 (in this edition as <space unit="chars" quantity="1"/>78-11-26a). M therefore sought a further extension of time; see M to R. Goldsworthy, 26 December 1878.</p>

                        <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>On 16 January 1879, Goldsworthy asked Forrest where matters stood, so that he could reply to M's request. Forrest replied:<space unit="chars" quantity="1"/>'I do not think he need be answered.

Since there is no further mention of the matter in the files, it would appear that the sale must have gone ahead, enabling M to retrieve his money.</p>
