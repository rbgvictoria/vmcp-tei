I felt hurt, that I am to be regarded as an ordinary selector, that my right of final approval is not recognized &amp; more that while I in good faith trusted to an arrangement being made, by which I could at least regain my £800 at any time, I now am in danger to loose the last I had in the world, the savings of several years, and this late in life, while in fluctuating health &amp; while my official position is not for a moment secure. My own impression is, my dear friend, that I could not raise more than £200 cash from the land, for which (or I understood) you <seg style="">
                  <hi rend="underline">temporarily</hi>
               </seg> applied, because 400 acres are the maximum of fair land of the whole 2000, the rest being hilly Jarrah country. You call it a valuable estate. If so the difficulty would be solved at once, because then it could be sold for what I gave, and I should be content to loose the interest of the money, for some of it for six years, while in the meanwhile the sum might have been doubled &amp; tripled by investment in Sheep.</p>

On 2 May, despite Fraser's opposing the application on the grounds that it would create a dangerous precedent (see M. Fraser to R.

Forrest replied: 'I do not think he need be answered. I have sold his right &amp; the application will be made in a day or two &amp; I do not anticipate any further difficulty' (Acc. 527, no. 345/8, State Record Office of WA). Since there is no further mention of the matter in the files, it would appear that the sale must have gone ahead, enabling M to retrieve his money.</p>
