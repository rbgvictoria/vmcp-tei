The builder cannot make much profit at that. Had I enjoyed during my official career a salary like that of most of my compeers, I might have many times bought such a house. Still if even only the £900 could be spent on new ground, I would get at least Office rooms again. No highminded man should ask me to be a functionary on my own former ground, except as Director. Is there really a difficulty to place the paupers, now in Gov. House domain, elsewhere? Surely they must be removed some early day. The buildings occupied by them might be fitted up for the £900 which I have on my estimates,<note xml:id="ftn2" type="footnote" n="2">
