I have been lecturing at Edinburgh on the subject and am going to give lectures in London. The fact is that we have too many people in England especially among the professional class consisting of Clergymen, Lawyers, medical men, men of Science officers of the Army &amp; Navy, Clerks in Public office &amp;c. — more in fact than we know what to do with — however I will send you out a copy of my lecture<note xml:id="ftn5" type="footnote" n="5">

He had been speaking on the topic throughout 1870; see, for example, the report of a meeting of the National Emigration League held at Mansion House London on 14 January 1870, <seg style="font-style: italic; ">Pall Mall gazette,</seg> 15 January 1870, p. 5.</p>
