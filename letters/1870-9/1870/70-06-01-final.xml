               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>In submitting the reply of Mr. W. Ferguson to the memorandum of the Undersecretary, I beg respectfully to remark, that the Inspector of forests in his official capacity for several months frequented the Office of the Lands Department, before he entered on duties at the botanic Garden also; and I need scarcely add, that at the Lands Office the Civil Service Regulations are visibly ported. He moreover would have seen these regulations fixed in the Garden Office also, had he attended there, as he was asked to do at the commencement of his duties, on the 16 December 1869, when in the presence of the Office Clerk he was requested to call every morning for such directions, as I had to give as responsible Director. This he failed to do, and this was brought in an official letter, dated and forwarded 6. January 1870,<note xml:id="ftn3" type="footnote" n="3">

The memorandum from the hon. the Chief Secretary required in my opinion neither notes nor explanations from me, but mere transmission, and this was effected through the Clerk of the office of the botanic Garden personally, from whom no questions were asked. </p>
