Neither do I recollect that Petersen ever complained to me of any injury caused to his eyesight by work in the botanic Garden, and if such was the case during the earlier years of his engagement he could not have observed the ordinary care and needful caution. That many peoples eyesight failes with advancing age, is well known. His work was mostly here in a good carpenters shade, and of such a nature as that of ordinary carpenters elsewhere. When with other employees he left on the occasion of the reductions in May last, he was quite able to work at his trade; indeed during July and August of this year I procured for him a few weeks carpenters work at the Industrial Museum in Melbourne, when he was quite able to use his tools as before, and he would gladly have continued at this temporary engagement, had more fund be available to myself for increasing still further the wood collection for the Sydney Exhibition;<note xml:id="ftn2" type="footnote" n="2">

               </note> nor did he complain in any way, altho since at least seven years while at work he wears spectacles. A few weeks ago he walked through the garden without such aid. If unknown to me any serious injury was caused to his eyesight here at any time, he must have been under medical treatment and would be able to produce medical testimony to that effect. I do not think, that Petersen needs fear any impending destitution, as 3 if not four of his children are grown up and earning or able to earn an independent livelyhood, only one of his children being yet at school, as far as I am aware. I also understand that he has a good brick house with ground as a free property at Emerald Hill<note xml:id="ftn3" type="footnote" n="3">

His wages were liberal while he was engaged here, namely from 1858 til Apr 1861 12/ for each work day 10 hours work; from Apr 1861 til Jan 1862 - 11/; from Jan til Sept 1862 - 10/; from Sept 1862 til May 1870 - 9/- he always finding tools himself. There was an occasional short intermission in his work, when he was either elsewhere employed under me (such as exhibition work) or not at all engaged under me. His engagement, made by myself in 1858, was <seg style="">
