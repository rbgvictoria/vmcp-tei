                  <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>From what I have seen here I am inclined to think some of the crystalline limestones of South Australia might, if carefully examined, yield similar interesting traces of ancient life. I allude particularly to those south of Adelaide associated with chloritic, dioritic, and micaceous schists. Should any opportunity occur of investigating them, perhaps you would bear it in mind. They would probably only be detected under the microscope. We have recently found some in a formation of crystalline limestone, the age of which is not well determined, but which rests unconformably on the older laurentian rock on which this (the eozoon) had previously been discovered. There seems to be some really good and extensive gold-fields here that only require hands to develop them in order to make them quite as profitable as many of the fields in Victoria. The Nova Scotia quartz yields, so far, a higher average than the Victorian, but the works are at present very limited.</seg>
