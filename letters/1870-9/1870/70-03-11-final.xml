                     </seg>The judges’ report is followed by a report from the fourth judge, James M'Intosh, recommending that the essay marked 'Pabulum' receive the £50 premium. The Council discussed the two reports at its meeting on 21 April 1870 and resolved ‘that Dr. Muecke be written to asking how much money he would require to publish the essay, and present the board with 100 copies’ (<seg style="font-style: italic; ">Argus</seg>, 22 April 1870, p. 5). Mücke’s reply has not been found but publication was evidently settled upon, for in its report to the Board of Agriculture, the Council noted that Mücke’s prize essay was shortly to be published. The Council went on to report that ‘in accordance with the recommendation of the judges’, a second prize, of £10, had been awarded to Thomas Agg. The Council added that it believed that 'to many who may be unable to follow the scientific essay of Dr. Muecke, Mr Agg's essay will be found a peculiarly profitable and interesting study', and noted that Agg ‘has promised to supply the board with 200 copies of the essay at his own expense’. See <seg style="font-style: italic; ">Leader</seg> (Melbourne), 20 August 1870, p. 7, and Agg (1870).</p>
