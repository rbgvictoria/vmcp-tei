               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>I have the honor to solicit, that you will be pleased to bring under the consideration of the honorable the President of the Board of Land and Works, that the metropolitan Parks under the control of the Board have been supplied since 1859 with specified 17450 plants from the botanic Garden, for which supply I hold in this establishment the receipts under existing regulations. These plants contained a very large proportion of the Himalaian and Californian Pines, now tourning up in all Directions, and frequently these could not have been received in masses elsewhere. I believe, that I am right in saying, that a very large share of the trees now growing in Fitzroy Park, in the Treasury Reserve Flagstaff Hill, Parliament House Reserve and South Park came as young plants directly from the botanic Garden, not to speak of several hundred plants, which bodily of large size were removed. I further have the honor to submit that the only gravel pits on my ground, which can be worked profitably, have largely supplied the gravel for Fitzroy Park, Treasury Reserve and Parliament House reserve, and that these pits are therewith exhausted. I have also rendered supply of some iron fourings,(?) once directly and once indirectly, and besides these Parks acquired access to good soil from the Yarra banks within the Reserve under my control. In all these supplies the interest of the botanic Garden itself has been for years to me of less consideration, than to serve other institutions, and indeed institutions all over the country. But as in the numerous unfair comparisons between the botanic Garden and the metropolitan Parks, the interest of my institution and the dignity of my position has been deeply injured I venture to ask as an act ofjustice, that the supplies rendered since a dozen years to the Reserve under the Board of Land and Works may be considered worthy of some public record, which, as far as I am aware, they never received, altho very small donations of a few plants from private Donors have been publicly acknowledged. I should not have asked for this act of grateful recognition, were I not anxious to protect the interests of the Garden, especially as it did not enjoy for years always free water supply, security against floods and other advantages of the metropolitan […] and had to serve also largely scientific puposes.</p>
