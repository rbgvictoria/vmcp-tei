It is deeply humiliating to me and gives me great pain, that such measure should have been adopted towards me late in life after so very many years services and the sacrifice of all my time and all my private property in the Department, and that my own professional position in the world should not be deemed sufficiently high, to advise the Government in reference to the administration of a Department, created mainly by myself, and about which I have only very recently been examined before the Civil Service Commission.</p>
