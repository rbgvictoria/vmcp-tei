               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>At a meeting of the Trustees of the Royal Park held on the 29th June 1869, one tender was selected from amongst eight tenders for one year's grazing right at the Royal Park, such tenders having been called for by due public notice.</p>
            <p rend="letter"
               style="font-family: Geneva; font-size: 12pt; "
               xml:lang="en">
               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>The tender thus accepted was sent in by Mr. Jos Roddick of Melbourne, and the amount of this tender was £208.—. E. Lissignol, then Ranger of the Park, was in attendance at that meeting, and received at once instructions verbally and on the same day in writing also, to carry out the necessary arrangements for giving effect to this tender, and to see to its due observance on behalf of the Trustees. On several subsequent occasions he stated to Dr. Thomas Black, one of the Trustees, that a lease was duly prepared, that the rents were received quarterly and paid regularly to the credit of the Trustees into the Bank of Victoria. It appears, however, from a report of Mr. W.F.A. Rucker, auditor, (report herewith annexed) that he purchased at once for the sum of £10 (Ten pounds) Mr. Jos Roddick's claims for grazing right without the knowledge and consent of the Board of Trustees; he also avoided to prepare any lease, but commenced forthwith to raise grazing fees as extensively as the nature of the Park permitted, and continued to do so till he left.</p>

               xml:lang="en">
               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>The fees were collected by the wife of lodgekeeper Meaker at the Royal Park, whom he authorized to obtain such fees, and whom he further intructed to give receipts on behalf of Mr. Jos Roddick, and to hand the proceeds over to himself. E. Lissignol also acknowledged the receipt of each payment to himself by entering the amounts on the blocks of the receipt books, and attaching to them Roddick's initials. Mr. Jos Roddick stated however, that he gave no authority for the use of his name or initials in these signatures. The proceeds so collected by Mrs Meaker and paid over from time to time to E. Lissignol from 26th June 1869 till 7th May 1870 amounted to Five hundred and five pounds thirteen shillings Sterling (£505.13/—[)]<note xml:id="ftn2" type="footnote" n="2">
