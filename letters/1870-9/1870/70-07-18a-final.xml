                     xml:lang="en">On 11 July 1870 John Hinze of 12 Martin Street, Emerald Hill, complained to McCulloch: 'Allow me to lay before you a grievance, I believe I am justified to compain of. I have been for more than six years employed as gardener in the Melbourne Botanical gardens and received last May my discharge. As I understand the discharge of the several employers [<seg style="font-style: italic; ">sic</seg>] has been made in consequence of your order, according to seniority. How is it then, that one young man Harry Moran who has been a shorter time employed at the gardens has not got discharge, and why find two other men, Cotterel and French, nearly constant work an [<seg style="font-style: italic; ">sic</seg>] live still in Cottages, belonging the garden? On the day of my leaving Dr. von Mueller promised me on his honor to employ me again in his Department [after] six weeks and settle with me my doing duty for about eighteen sundays. Neither of these promises Dr. von Mueller has fulfilled. If Dr. von Mueller pleads wa[nt] of funds, why then did he raise the Clark two shillings and the Messenger one shilling I am sure Dr von Mueller will have no just cause to complain of me and I have the promise of Mr. Fergusson to testify to my character as well as to my abilites. I therefore beg of you, you will kindly take my case into consideration and see justice done.' (V70/7735, unit 468, VPRS 3991/P, Public Record Office, Victoria). Hinze's letter was referred to M for comment on 13 July.</p>

               xml:lang="en">1, As regards gardener Moran, who is junior to Hinze by only 6 months, being employed in the Botanic Garden, I beg to submit as a reason, that this man's wages are only 5/ p diem, while Hinze was in receipt of 8/; moreover Moran was ill for several months at the beginning of the year, for which time he received no remuneration whatsoever, and has besides an aged mother and a sick sister in a great measure depending on his earnings. He has at present similar work to that which Hinze would do, to perform. He being <seg style="">

Otherwise they are mainly engaged in painting and writing labels for plants under the vote for Public Works, for which skilled labor Hinze is not competent. Cottrell continues besides for an hour daily to attend to the feeding of the birds, which requires some experience. Both these men have young children,<note xml:id="ftn3" type="footnote" n="3">

It is not true that I refused to pay for these extra duties on Sunday, but I advised Hinze not to press a claim so unjust and exorbitant; if however the Honorable the Chief Secretary deems it desirable, this claim might be recognized, but 5/ for each Sunday would be ample remuneration.</p>
