               </note> I have the honor to submit respectfully the following explanation of the circumstances of their misunderstandings for the information of the General Board of the trustees. I sent weeks ago the young man, who transacts since 12 years the town business for my Department to request that when the articles, sent by me to Sydney, came back, they should be delivered directly to me in first instance, as I am alone acquainted with their nature of all; and in the same manner I did get the five cases of living plants, when sent back to me some weeks ago. These cases were certainly sent by Mr Moore<note xml:id="ftn2" type="footnote" n="2">

To both Mr Moore and Prof. Smith I gave Mr Levey letters of introduction. I never for a moment thought, that the other cases, about which a dispute has arisen, required to be obtained differently, and mentioned on Mr Leveys return, when passing him hurriedly, that I should like to fetch them direct from the railway, and certainly did not understand that any special objection to this simplifying business was raised.

               </note> I went on the afternoon before yesterday to the Exhibition building to obtain them, and not finding Mr Levey I asked his assistant to let me have the articles, as I could not possibly unpack them in the annex, and should be obliged otherwise to give that evening notice in the papers, that my lecture would be postponed. I told him, that I was a public Officer holding a position of trust and never yet had found any difficulties in matters of this kind, and would hold myself responsible for the goods; and on receiving the articles I caused my town agent, who took delivery, to give a receipt in my name. So little did I foresee any difficulties or the necessity of further formalities, that it not even occurred to me as necessary, to find one of the trustees to give further formal consent for the removal. If it has occurred to me as necessary, I would have written formally for getting the whole sending back to my Department in first instance, but I scarcely ever find in other similar cases such formality necessary, having always enjoyed the trust &amp; respect of those, with whom I came into business contact. Yesterday morning Mr Levey called on me to demand the return of the whole consignments by noon of this day; but not only felt I deeply hurt by this demand, as evincing a want of faith, but I pointed also out, that the cases were opened the evening before and unpacked, with a view of getting the material for my lecture, to complete what I required. I pointed out in the presence of the Rev. Dr Bleasdale, who also demanded the return of the goods by this day noon, that I should find it almost impossible to repack the things, as I had to work during much of the day for the lecture, and requested both from Mr Levey and the Rev. Dr Bleasdale to defer the matter til this afternoon, when I would wait on the general Board of the trustees and receive further instructions. Not even so small a consideration was however shown to me, as to allow the affair to stand over for one single day, and I received last night, just when I was to commence lecturing and when my mind ought not to have been disturbed by harassing communications, a letter from Mr Levey, that he had been instructed by the Exhibition Committee to demand back the goods by noon of this day, otherwise the young Assistant of his would be dismissed. To shield this perfectly innocent Gentleman from the effects of so great and harsh injustice, I have with much trouble indeed managed to pack up again and to return all the goods received the day before yesterday by me. The whole treatment I regard also towards myself perfectly undeserved, particularly as I have given much time and even private means to assist in the Sydney Exhibition, the whole grant made by the Executive Committee after repeated urgent applications having been thirty three pounds (£33) including packing of the very many things sent by me.</p>
