                     <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>It may be remembered that some years ago a talented and engaging French nobleman — the Marquis of Beauvoir, while on a "voyage round the world," paid a visit to Melbourne, and took great interest in examining our various institutions. Among others, he was greatly struck with the Botanic-gardens, and no doubt also with its talented curator, Dr. (now Baron von) Mueller. It is to be feared, however, that the doctor rather took advantage of the marquis's credulity, if the account of Dr. Mueller's achievements as related by the noble visitor is to be traced to our Government botanist. The subjoined letter was recently received by the Lands department here from an official source in South Australia: — Sir, —I have the honour to enclose an extract from a work published in London in 1870, entitled A Voyage Round the World, by the Marquis of Beauvoir, and to request that you will be kind enough to inform me whether the statements therein contained are reliable in point of fact. <space unit="chars" quantity="1"/>. . . . 'With equal boldness and perseverance, Dr. Mueller has set up beacons for adventurous spirits of the rising generation. He is enthusiastic for every noble end. He encourages the new squatters, and tells them 'beyond the white stormy desert, the granite and sand, you will find pastures for thousands of herds.' But the misfortune of Australia is want of water. He wishes to remedy this, and to this end consecrated almost all the funds of the Botanical-gardens, and he is succeeding. He distributes over the interior of the country thousands of shrubs reared in his nurseries. Little streams form rapidly round the young woods. The results are splendid already, and each year confirms them. On barren plains he has created woods and streams in more than a hundred places'. <space unit="chars" quantity="1"/>
