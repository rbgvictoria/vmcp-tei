The sender is identified as 'Mr Edward Schmidt, of Tambo, on the Barcoo, Queensland'; his name is corrected elsewhere in the article. The text is introduced with the following information: ‘The message is somewhat ambiguous, but it is supposed that some of the missing explorer’s instruments and writings have been found. The telegram is dated August 2, and is as follows:’.</p>

The same item was also published in the <seg style="font-style: italic; ">Northern Territory times and gazette</seg>, 16 October 1875. The item continued: </p>

It is of course possible that the party were on their return march, after having pushed as far as their resources would permit them, and if this be really the case, and there are papers found with the bleached bones of the gallant explorers, we shall presently have added an interesting chapter to Australian history.</p>
