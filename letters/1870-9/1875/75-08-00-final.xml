The text given here is from 'Mr Ernest Giles' Expedition’, an account of the first part of Giles' fourth expedition, from Central Australia to Perth, that was published in <seg style="font-style: italic; ">South Australian register</seg>, 20 August 1875, p. 4. Thomas Elder is the probable recipient of M’s letter as the article is introduced by 'By the courtesy of the Hon. Thomas Elder we have been placed in possession of particulars respecting Mr Giles' exploratory movements during the past three months'. The report was republished elsewhere, e.g. <seg style="font-style: italic; ">Ballarat star</seg>, 27 August 1875, p. 4. </p>

The botanical specimens have already been forwarded to Baron von Mueller for classification, and in a letter, acknowledging their arrival in Melbourne, that gentleman expresses his belief that two or three of the plants are new, and that many of the others are of considerable geographical interest.<note xml:id="ftn2" type="footnote" n="2">

[E.] Giles's travels in Australia in 1875 and 1876' that dealt with the third and fourth expeditions (B77.09.01, B77.10.01 and B77.11.03). They had apparently been held back in the expectation of a published account of the journeys, to which they would have been added as an appendix similar to that accompanying the account of Giles' previous expeditions, B75.13.05 (see B77.09.01, p. 269).</p>
