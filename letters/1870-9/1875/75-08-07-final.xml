I was the first to introduce these huge ferns to Europe, though it might have been done 300 years ago from South Africa and nearly 100 years ago from New South Wales. It is also pleasing to me, that I have mainly initiated the large export of ferntrees to Europe and solely to N. America now also; and so it is with the already extensive export of tall <name key="Cycas">Cycas</name>stems from Queensland. I mention all this to show you, that I am actively still engaged in horticultural interchanges; thus therefore all Mr. Sargents sendings can be directed to me as before.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>I am delighted at the progress of your N. American Flora, which will to a large extent elucidate also that of Canada &amp; Mexico. At the end of this century, so I anticipate, nearly all the plants of the globe will be known &amp; a complete system, except of minute cryptogams, be constructed. In Australia now already novelties turn up very sparingly, though we will occasionally trace additional Indian plants into this continent.</p>

The Fragm. have guarded him against endless errors, into which he would have fell, and the Fragmenta also have cleared up subsequently numerous incorrect treatments of the plants in the volumes of the flora published before.

Here as a foreigner I am enveyed, resulting in my votes, my buildings, my staff &amp;c nearly all being swept away.
