                        <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>After performances in Sydney, Anna Bishop and party (including her second husband, Martin Schultz) arrived in Melbourne on 9 January 1875 where she gave 'three grand concerts' at the Athenaeum, the first on 12 January (advertisement, <seg style="font-style: italic; ">Argus</seg>, 11 January 1875, p. 8). On 18 January she also sang at the Metropolitan Liedertafel social evening, the evening before her departure for Adelaide ('Metropolitan Liedertafel Concert', <seg style="font-style: italic; ">Argus, </seg>19 January 1875, p. 5). On her return to Melbourne she performed at further 'Grand Concerts', beginning with one sponsored by the Early Closing Association at the Melbourne Town Hall on 20 February (advertisement, <seg style="font-style: italic; ">Argus</seg>, 18 February 1875, p. 4), and at further 'Farewell popular concerts' (advertisement, <seg style="font-style: italic; ">Argus</seg>, 23 February 1875, p. 8). She also performed at the Melbourne German Liedertafel 'anniversary festival' on 1 March (<seg style="font-style: italic; ">Argus</seg>, 2 March 1875, p. 5) .She departed on a provincial tour after a 'Grand extra concert' on 8 March (advertisement<seg style="font-style: italic; ">, Argus</seg>, 8 March 1875, p. 12). It is unlikely that M’s letter was written after the concert of 20 February, as mails from Sydney to San Francisco took around 28 to 35 days; the February mail for San Francisco from Melbourne closed on 10 February ('Post Office Notice', <seg style="font-style: italic; ">Argus</seg>, 10 February 1875, p. 4).</p>
