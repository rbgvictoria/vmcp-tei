The text is introduced by reporting that, following the receipt of an initial telegram (see [E. Schneider] to M, 2 August 1875 (in this edition as 75-08-02a)), a telegram had been received from Brisbane casting doubt on the reported discovery and asserting that the remains were undoubtedly those of Aborigines. The report continued: ‘The previous information, however, would appear to be corroborated by another telegram which Baron von Mueller received from Mr. Schneider yesterday to the effect that the remains were those of whites, and that with them were found a Swedish Bible. Mr. Schneider being a surgeon, there can be no doubt that the intelligence of the skeletons being those of white men is correct.’ See also [E. Schneider] to M, 3 August 1875.</p>

                     <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>The report concludes with the following information: ‘The Baron has telegraphed back, thanking Mr Schneider for his exertions, and stating that so soon as the relics are identified he will consult the ladies Committee, who it will be recollected, some years since raised funds, and sent out an expedition for the discovery of Leichhardt if alive, and of his remains if dead. The Baron further suggests to Mr Schneider that a magisterial inquiry should be made in regard to the discoveries, in order that as much information as possible may be elicited. The words in Mr Schneider's telegram "quartz" and "send order to Pender for same", are not understood by the Baron, but no doubt a further communication, explanatory of everything will shortly be received and most probably in the course of time a letter containing full details of the discovery.’ M's telegram not found.</p>
