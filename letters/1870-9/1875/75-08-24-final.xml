            <p rend="letter"

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>In compliance with your request I have the honor of submitting briefly my professional views on the reconstruction of my Department. I would respectfully recommend: 1, that the bot. Garden should be retransferred from the Lands Department to that of the honorable the Chief Secretary, under whom it was placed like the Observatory and other scientific institutions for so many years. 2, that the Directorship of the botanic Garden may devolve again on the Gov. Botanist, whose staff, buildings, plants and votes are concentrated at the bot. Garden, and who moreover might reduce the expenditure of the maintenance of the bot. Garden, which was far less (with wider obligations) in former than in the last 2 years. 3, that the services of the present curator of the botan. Garden be maintained under the Lands Department for the administration of some or all the urban Gardens and Parks, for which ample provision separately exists.</p>
            <p rend="letter"
               style="font-family: Geneva; font-size: 12pt; "
               xml:lang="en">
               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>This proposition would resecure professional knowledge and economy for the reconstructed Department, without injustice to any one. But if at present any difficulties should exist for realizing the arrangement now respectfully proposed, then I would solicit, that at least some modest provisions may be made on the additional estimates for a field-collector, messenger, laboratory work, travelling expenses, books, journals, instruments, lithographic and xylographic work, the issue of a School-flora, additions to the Museum-space &amp; to the Museum-collections, in as much as the £300, granted in each of the last two years, are only sufficient for the salary of the Museum-Clerk and for museum material. It may be permitted to add, that I am most anxious to push on again vigorous research with restored means for industrial and educational purposes in due combination of ornamentation work with that of instruction and remunerative utility; and this of course could be done only at a very limited extent since I left the Garden by the sacrifice of my salary or own private means.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>The formation of a new botanic Garden on new ground, involving very many years work, is — I fear — beyond my strength late in life now, though I would endeavour to create thus a new department if fair means for the purpose were placed at my disposal.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>An hereditary tendency to phthisis would prevent me to undertake duties of any kind at the University, even if a vacancy occurred or otherwise provision could be made there, or if my administrative duties (similar to those of the Gov. Astronomer, the Chief Gov. medical officer &amp;c) could be carried out at any University. In a similar manner, the establishment of the Gov. Botanist of England, Dr. Hooker, is at Kew not at the London University.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>Even if well supported, I have 10 years literary work before me yet, work which will serve for all times and for the benefit of all Departments and all districts and sections of the community; these forthcoming or intended labours would only be retarded by the unavoidable additional work connected with any University position, while the daily observations in the open air at the bot. Garden among my plants, already introduced, and to which largely ought to be added, would greatly facilitate the scientific and utilitarian researches expected from my office.</p>
