               </note> No phytographic worker has ever been more careful in adopting correct names than myself. I can fairly state that I have reduced thousands of useless synonyms of other writers on Australian plants first, to their real names; instance <name key="Calythrix%20tetragona">Calythrix tetragona</name>, to which I reduced correctly seventeen species of acknowledged high authorities; and if on rare occasions I, like my compeers, have adopted provisional names, there was full reason for it, which must be apparent to the meanest understanding. Even in so difficult a genus as Eucalyptus—in which first of all by myself sound principles for specific demarcation were established—nearly all the species (about half a hundred) established by me have stood the test of comparison with original specimens of species previously known and mostly ill-described before my time. That in such a genus an occasional duplicity<note xml:id="ftn3" type="footnote" n="3">

Thus it was for a very long time uncertain when this, my E. diversicolor—one of the fifty called Blue Gum tree of West Australia—was identical with the famous Karri tree;<note xml:id="ftn4" type="footnote" n="4">

Ramel made his comment in a letter headed 'Les Eucalyptus en Australie' in the February 1875 issue of <seg style="font-style: italic; ">L'illustration horticole</seg>, vol. 22, p. 32, a letter that was translated into Portuguese in the November issue of <seg style="font-style: italic; ">Jornal de horticultura practica</seg>

               </note> It seems almost beneath one's dignity to spend time in refuting attacks, such as the one in your number of Feb. 20; but the baseless attacks of traducers have brought an honourable departmental position to the dust (while under the Civil Service regulations of this colony I could not defend myself), and no one in Europe seems to care to aid in rebuilding it, so far as I can perceive. Whenever in my writings E. colossea was mentioned it was coupled with the vernacular name "Karri," hence there could be no great difficulty in finding out what it was, and even that difficulty could have been easily removed by a letter to myself. There are still several Eucalypti about whose exact specific position I am uncertain, and to avoid confusion temporary names have to be adopted for them. Even after many centuries of the study of plants in your own country the controversy about the British Oaks in not yet brought to a close—i.e., whether you have one species with two varieties, or two species. Cannot then some allowance be made for 150 Eucalypti? Surely, therefore, a little more charity might have been shown in this instance to a distant foreign worker, who would fain have hoped that he had struggled here against illiberality and envy for a quarter of a century not altogether in vain.<note xml:id="ftn7" type="footnote" n="7">

The sentence, "Of this we might adduce numerous instances," refers to the preceding clause — "a plant once thoroughly known under a certain name by gardeners, retains it to the end." We believe, however, that we are right in stating that Baron </seg>
