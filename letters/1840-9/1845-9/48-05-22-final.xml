I hope to get you a good lot of things shortly in the mean time please to write to me &amp; if you can send me the names of the plants you were exploring when I left Adelaide I should be much obliged, particularly of the creeper near <name key="Billardiera">Billardiera</name> also the blue flowered linear leaved plant also in <name key="Pittosporae">Pittosporae</name> &amp; if you could give me the Natural orders of them I think I could remember what is in the collection without aid of a duplicate, I am at last settled in a place where I have convenience for preserving specimens &amp; shall not let slip any opportunity of obtaining them for <seg style="">
