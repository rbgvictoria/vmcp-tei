I know not if you have had any communication with him, but if so you will find him profuse of offers &amp; promises, but take my word for it you will never get any thing more, but of this you will be a judge should you ever see or write to him, but I have said enough about him, and so in order that I would not cause any disappointment I have forwarded you I think in the 2 Boxes near 600 genera &amp; sp. many of which were not in his possession, &amp; of which you will find duplicates &amp; triplicates, so that after all it is perhaps better as it is, as those specimens with him were small, these are all I can promise you this season but I hope to resume the next, I have now begun to make up the unfortunate loss of Cryptogamous plants pr "Henry"<seg rend="FootnoteReference" style="font-size: 8pt; ">
