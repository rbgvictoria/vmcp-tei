               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>It needs not my assurance, dear Mr Brodribb, that I feel much honored with the offer of becoming President of the Australian Geographic Society, to be founded by you and your friends. Though probably only a short space of time remains left to me after my 35 years of uninterrupted toil in these far southern parts of her Majesty's dominions, I shall yet promote geographic interests as readily on the evening of my life, as during its earlier periods. In forming however a federal Society for Geography in the Australian Colonies, some difficulties present themselves to us; and I would like at the outset to offer a few observations for your further consideration. By starting the Society in the oldest Australian Colony, no jealousy could possibly arise in the other colonial territories here, it being understood, that the permanent Central Seat of the Society would remain in Sydney; but in such a case the Presidency ought to devolve on a Gentleman in New South Wales, unless it was to be held under any circumstances only for one year, as is the rule in our two medical Societies here. Perhaps it would also be well to consider, whether seniority in geographic research should claim precedence; in that case the hon. A. C. Gregory, M.L.C., C.M.G., of Brisbane would be entitled to the first years Presidency; and not only would he fill the office with dignity, but he would also have leisure to watch the interest of the new association. — Perhaps it might be advisable to elect a Vice President in each of the Australian Colonies; such a position I would be happy to fill as representant of Victoria; in this manner all the Colonies would be represented on the Council, and local cooperation would be secured in all parts of Australia. Whether however it would be possible for me, to attend any of the meetings in Sydney, remains very doubtful. My health has been fluctuating for some years, so that with much regret I was obliged to beg of the Field Naturalists Club and of the Turn-Verein to confer the honor of President on another Gentleman then<note xml:id="ftn2" type="footnote" n="2">

               </note> myself. Moreover I find late in life my professional work surrounded by far more difficulties than in former years; nor have I in any way prospered during my long and labourious career; therefore the completion of my literary works, for which I have made every sacrifice in life, has become more retarded than under former facilities; hence my time is now less free for extra duties, than it was in bye-gone years. I think therefore, that the Presidency of the new Australian geographic Society should devolve on a Gentleman, who by easier circumstances in life could give to so important a position the needful attention. By this arrangement I should not be prevented to write occasionally a short adress, or furnish some other communications, while it would remain to me a particular source of pleasure to advocate the cause of geography in an association like yours, as I have done independently for fully one third of a century.</p>
