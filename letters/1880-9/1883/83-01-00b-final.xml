This journey is mentioned in M to J. O'Shanassy, 24 October 1858, published as B58.11.02 (see p. 8), but does not report the forest of beech.</p>
               </note> In that year I travelled (alone, with one horse only) through the ranges from near Colac to Cape Otway, and passed through a great extent of these beech forests. But as the same kind of timber was more readily accessible to me from Western Gipps Land, from Wilson's Promontory, and also from Tasmania, your forests were, until lately, not put under requisition for beech timber.</p>

It occurs in damp forest valleys, from the southern part of Queensland, through New South Wales and Gipps Land, to near the Curdie River where it attains its western geological limits. I included the wood of this tree in several timber collections since 1854, for the great exhibitions, though trees of considerable dimensions are comparatively rare. It is also a native of Tasmania.</p>
