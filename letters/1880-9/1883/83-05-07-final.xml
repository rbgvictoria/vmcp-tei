                     xml:lang="en">See T. Wilson to M, 28 April 1883. James Thomson, Secretary to the Victorian Commission for the Calcutta International Exhibition, 1883-84, wrote to the Chief Secretary, G. Berry, on 28 April 1883: 'I have the honour by direction of the president, Joseph Bosisto, Esqr M.P. to state that a special effort is being made to ensure a thorough representation of the indigenous products of Victoria at the forthcoming international Exhibition at Calcutta, and the Commission will be glad to receive the assistance of the Government Botanist in the matter. It is proposed to form collections of seeds, dried plants, &amp;c and at the close of the Exhibition to present them to various public institutions in India, with the view of obtaining analogous collections in exchange. The high scientific attainments and world-wide reputation of Baron von Muëller would combine to greatly enhance the value of any such collection which might be forwarded from the colony, and the Commission trusts therefore that you will be so good as to invite his co-operation in the direction indicated.' The Under Secretary, T. Wilson, immediately referred this letter to M with a covering letter. M to T. Wilson 11 May 1883 (in this edition as 83-05-11a) returned the file referring to the letter above (Y83/4315, unit 1407, VPRS 3991/P, <space unit="chars" quantity="1"/>PROV).</p>
               </note> I beg to inform the honorable the Chief Secretary, that I shall in accordance with his wish endeavour to bring together as many industrial articles, as may be within my reach departmentally or otherwise for the Calcutta Exhibition.<note xml:id="ftn2" type="footnote" n="2">

               </note> In an establishment like that, administrated by me, vegetable resources would claim my attention. Thus woodspecimens in a presentable form, Tan-material, Gums, Resin, fibres and other products and educts of plants would be got together, so far <seg style="">

               </seg>. Thus I would not advise, that indiscriminately seed-collections are made up for the Exhibition, as only a very small percentage of such seeds would represent mercantile goods. The same remark applies to fibres, of which only such would be chosen by me, as could be got for practical purposes in large quantity cheaply, and as would readily yield to manufactural processes at rope-work, in paper-mills, on looms &amp;c. Large numbers of samples might be prepared, if no restrictions are adopted, but such indiscriminate exhibits would be misleading to a great extent. I find it my duty, to point this out, as I should not aim at quantity, but <seg style="">

M replied 'I would respectfully suggest, that £140 be extra provided on the new estimates for special preparation of articles illustrative of Victorian vegetable resources for the Calcutta exhibition through the Gov. Botanists establishment. If my original complete Department was still available for me, I would not venture to ask for any subsidy at all' (M to T.

Thomson, returned it on 23 May with no indication of what action, if any, was proposed. However, estimates of 'miscellaneous' expenditure in the Chief Secretary's department for 1884 included £5,500 for 'expenses in connexion with the exhibition to be held at Calcutta' (<seg style="font-style: italic; ">Estimates of the revenue and expenditure for the year ending 30th June, </seg>1884, Victoria, Parliamentary paper no. B 2, p. 16). Expenditure of the grant was the responsibility of the Commissioners for the exhibition; their financial summary (Calcutta International Exhibition Commissioners (1884), p. 8) includes £509/7/7 for 'defraying cost of forming collections of indigenous products, mineral and geological specimens'.</p>
