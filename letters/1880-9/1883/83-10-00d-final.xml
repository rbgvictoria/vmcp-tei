               </note> the limits between real botanic gardens and ordinary public horticultural places are, as a rule, not distinctly drawn, the former being more essentially establishments for science, the others more particularly places for recreation and amusement, although the former may secondarily be pleasure gardens also, and the latter afford likewise secondarily some means for study. With this view, doubtless many Continental botanic gardens aim at scientific utility, mainly or even solely, more especially so as their scanty fund in most instances is quite inadequate to do more. If we would only recognise that true botanic gardens are primarily gardens plus science, while municipal gardens, cemetery gardens, &amp;c., primarily are gardens minus science, then much about the competitive difficulties of these two classes of horticultural establishments would vanish, and in fairness no more would be expected from either of them than was intended, and each class would be left peacefully to its own proper pursuits, and not attempt to do both duties with conflicting interests and insufficient resources. You in your able article have touched some of the many points also already advanced by me, but much might be added to your remarks, and in venturing to make from a large experience of former years some further suggestions I beg it to be clearly understood at once that no one can be a greater advocate for esthetic and scenic culture also in botanic gardens, properly so-called, than myself.

               </note> But to my mind, when a botanic garden is to fulfil its functions to the highest extent, the main planting should be ruled by strictly scientific principles, which procedure, however, need not exclude a few ornamental lawns, some little decoration in the way of flower borders, such as I saw in German gardens fully forty years ago, but which is costly and unproductive.</p>
            <p rend="letter"

               <seg style="">In old-established ground he who has to deal with the planting operations of a strictly botanic garden is probably hampered, because he likes to respect the work of his predecessors, as he expects his own work afterwards to be respected. But on new ground all planting should be performed on strictly scientific considerations. Thus I gradually, even on older grounds, rearranged the plants, geographically, systematically, and industrially. Nearly each part of the garden had in this way its distinct meaning; the larger portion of the area was devoted to geographic planting, for which in the warm temperate zone we have here, perhaps, ten times greater facilities than in northern or even middle Europe. Thus, North and South America had their own large areas, so also North and South Asia, North and South Africa, and North and South Europe, due scope being given to Eastern and Western Australia, also to New Zealand and Polynesia; and I found no difficulty in introducing at the same time the scenic elements, though I did not sacrifice old specimen trees foreign to any of the adopted geographic divisions of the grounds, but left them unlabelled to divert primary attention from them. This geographic arrangement I adopted nearly fifteen years ago in the Palm-house and smaller conservatory, inasmuch as the plants of the Western Hemisphere were kept on the western side of the building, the plants of the Eastern Hemisphere on the eastern side, and Northern and Southern plants again being placed respectively. It is obvious how easily plants are thus to be found, even by strangers, either in extensive open grounds or anywhere under glass. The systematic planting done in 1857 was strictly according to Jussieu's system, allied orders of plants coming into juxtaposition, and the whole forming a compact plantation, not a dissevered scattering of odd orders of plants over wide areas, with the loss of all facilities for comparison of the genera and species of cognate orders. Monocotyledons and Acotyledons were not planted for want of means at the time, and an improvement in the systematic arrangement could be effected by distributing the <name key="Apetaleae">Apetaleae</name> (except the <name key="Gymnospermeae">Gymnospermeae</name>), among the orders nearest to them in alliance. The industrial ground was not extensive, and my desire was to enlarge still more the division for grasses, medicinal, textile, tanning, and any other utilitarian groups of plants — a special work, which went through several editions, having purposely been written to promote the study of these plants;</seg>

               <seg style=""> Extensive phytographic writers perhaps occasionally forgot, or unconsciously never recognised, that they owe their main auxiliaries really to botanic gardens. Who among descriptive botanists was not glad to go from the herbarium to the class ground of the garden to study in Nature, comparatively, leaf-buds, preflorescence, location, and directions of ovules, dimorphism, colour of flowers, and a multitude of characteristics with ease, which in herbaria are traced with difficulty altogether or lost, not to speak of sacrificing specimens of dried plants, particularly if such are glued down. What monographer would not hail with delight a collection of the plants in cultivation coming under his review? — especially if the monograph pertains to trees, the bark, wood, habit, and defoliation, &amp;c., requiring to be studied, as I myself most seriously experienced when endeavouring to deal satisfactorily with the Eucalypts. No; on this question of the high importance of real botanic gardens, for descriptive botany there ought to be only one voice. Then how is he on whom it may devolve to call forth or to foster new resources, to fulfil his functions, without living plants under his immediate care? Agriculture, forestry, technologic industries, pastoral concerns, designs truthful to Nature for artistic purposes, cannot much be advanced either by a herbarium or by simple pleasure gardening. Furthermore, how is the raw material for the technologist or phytochemic laboratory to be obtained readily except from a botanic garden worthy of the name? That such material cannot always be obtained from plants of decorative value must be evident, though thus far the unthinking portion of the public may, perhaps, cry down, even in a new country, any plant not decorative. Gardens, plain and simple, for amusement, or for pleasure walking, ought to be near the centres of populations; botanic gardens, on the other hand, should be more in quiet retreats. From the united action of leading botanic gardens in the world we may expect henceforth the issue of standard annual catalogues, based on intimate and special knowledge, for universal use, just as the annual nautical almanacs serve all navigators simultaneously. Could my wishes have been realised, we should have had also here, as recommended everywhere else, regular monthly reports, emanating also from our botanic garden, relating to temperature in its influence on thousands of reliably named specific forms in vegetation, referring to pathological data, bringing descriptive notes on new or rare plants arisen under local cultivation, setting forth the time of flowering and fruiting of multitudes of species, and dwelling on hundreds of the phenomena in plant life.</seg>
