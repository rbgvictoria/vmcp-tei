               </note> He was anxious to secure a leading Forester's position in the new service of N.S. Wales, and he would be particularly fitted as head of the calculating and draftsmen-branch by virtue of his mathematic knowledge and artistic skill. It was unreasonable, to ask admittance at Kew except as a Volunteer for a short time, and to expect that valuable time of your own should be given up to him. I fear, his large and yet young family and the illness of his accomplished Lady, whom he married here (a Victorian) consumed all his fund, so that he could not muster the passage money for the family to N.S.W.</p>

As he held a position, while Lieutenant, at the Danish Court, he ought to have no difficulty to secure a few lines of recommendation from H.R.H. the Princess of Wales, and thus secure the Sydney appointment, which he covets, especially as his wife finds the Middle European Winters too cold.

The performance of Haendel's Messiah and especially of Beethovens Choral Symphony was absolutely sublime! Altogether these were the grandest Concerts ever given in Australia and perhaps anywhere in the Southern Hemisphere.
