Wilson, returned the account to M requesting: 'Will the Govt Botanist be good to give me a reference to the authority under which this expenditure was incurred'. On 30 March, M replied: 'The Exhibition referred to will be simply a horticultural Show of a week's duration though on a large scale, to which I was asked to contribute as an honorary member of the Hortic. Society of St Petersburg; similar international Exhibitions were held once there before, also in Florence and some other places, when some fernstems and other vegetable Exhibits were sent by me as a Departmental Conribution in the way of ordinary sendings for interchanges, without then special authority being deemed requisite. So soon as I hear of the safe arrival of this splendid specimen there, I will report the fact to the hon. the Chief Secretary. Our bot. Museum here received a large lot of dried specimens of Siberian plants from the Director of the bot. Garden of St Petersburg, under whose chairmanship the forthcoming international hortic. Show is to be carried out; hence the sending of this Giant Todea is made in reciprocity, but also, as a sort of advertisement for future exports of these particular kinds of ferns, in the same manner, in which the extensive export of Victorian Ferntrees has mainly originated through me.'</p>

M replied on 4 April: 'As I am now aware of the views of the hon. the Chief Secretary on unusual expenditures of this kind, which however very seldom occur, I shall not fail to submit any similar case in first instance for the consideration of the Government.'</p>
