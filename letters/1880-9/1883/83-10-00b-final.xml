                     xml:lang="en">MS is glued to the back of the title page of a copy of Guilfoyle (1883). The introduction to Guilfoyle's work is dated April 1883. Guilfoyle inscribed this copy: 'To Sir Joseph D. Hooker, KCSI. CB. P.L.S. &amp;c &amp;c &amp;c Director, Royal Gardens Kew With the Authors Comps 9th October 1883.' He inscribed another copy held in the Library: 'To George Bentham Esq F.R.S <space unit="chars" quantity="1"/>&amp;c &amp;c &amp;c 25 Wilton Place S.W. London With the writers kind regards 12.

MS has no salutation or valediction. The text, on both sides of one folio, appears to be a postscript to another letter; if so, it was probably included with M to W. Thiselton-Dyer, 9 October 1883 (in this edition as 83-10-09a), which was answered on 26 November 1883.</p>
