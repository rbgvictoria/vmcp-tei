How many are printed &amp; how are they disposed of'. Ferres replied on 8 May: 'Mueller's "Fragmenta", 500 [copies printed], [Distributed] To Departments, Visitors from other Countries, Horticultural Societies — on authorised requisitions, and by sale. "Botanic Teachings" 3000 To members of Parliament, Departments, Mechanics Institutes, Public Libraries, Horticultural Societies, Visitors from other Colonies — authorised requisitions, and by sale. "Native Plants" 3000 Ditto. "Eucalyptographia" 1000 Ditto'. In a letter of 11 May Ferres added: 'I find that none of the Newspapers are supplied with copies of the "Fragmenta" from this office, therefore, if they obtain it, Baron von Mueller must supply it. The Baron obtains 100 copies in parts, stitched, and 100 copies, bound in cloth. All his other works are supplied to the three papers from this office.' On 11 May Service asked: 'On what authority is the Baron supplied with these 200 copies — Please let me see it this afternoon'. Ferres replied on 11 May: 'I regret that the authority has been destroyed, but the copies as stated have been supplied for many years, if not from the commencement in 1859'. See also M to E. Thomas, 17 May 1883.</p>
