In olden times it was customary in Sweden, that University Students chose a particular name, and to this often added the Latin syllable -us. Especially among Divines were such names very usual; thus we have had Archbishop Rydeling, Benzelius, and many others; in this manner the name of Linné was Carl Linnaeus; and so did he write it himself in all his publications, (whether Latin or Swedish) till he became ennobled. In former times it was here also very customary that whosoever was thus honoured, adopted a new name; and it was on this occasion that Linnaeus altered his name to Linné, writing either Carl Linné or Carl von Linné, or in his subsequent Latin works, Carolus a Linné, (vide Dissertatio de coloniis plantarum (1768), Planta Aphyleia (1776), and some other writings); but he wrote also Carolus Linné (Dissertatio de Erica 1770), and Carolus von Linné (Dissertatio de Cimicifuga (1774), Plantae Surinamenses (1775). Whether it was Linné himself or the then King (Gustav III.), who put the name into a French form, I must leave undecided." It may be added, that in Germany and Denmark, the name of the great Reformator in Natural History, is also usually written Linné.</p>
