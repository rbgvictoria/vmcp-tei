               </note> an official call has been made on me, to supply woodbooks for the new collections of the Exhibition-Building here. Thus I shall not be able to supply so many samples for your Museum, as otherwise would have been the case. Under these circumstances it will be best for you, to get all the wood-books made in Sydney, especially as there are very few kinds of woods in Victoria, which do not also occur in N.S.W. I would however advise, not to adopt for smaller specimens of wood the mere rectangular slab-form, because the polishing and labelling will cost as much as the same for immitative books therefore the expense for each final sample can be very little less. I had also some <seg style="">
                  <hi rend="underline">folio</hi>
               </seg>-woodbooks made for the Calcutta-Exhibition, besides the mainlot of octavo-books; the latter cost 6/, the former 7/6 here; and assuredly they are more elegant and handy than mere pieces of polished wood. In declaring myself ready, to supervise for your Museum some work here, I thought the experience of the local artisan might be secured and also more extensively the accurate naming; moreover you seem to have overlooked, that within the small sum proposed, £25, a lot of other wood articles would have been procured, all labelled correct to names. I think it would be well, if in adopting the book-form for wood samples, a uniform size and form of labelling was everywhere adhered to; this I have impressed on the Exhibition Commissioners both in Amsterdam and Calcutta, with a view of facilitating interchanges of wood-books all of one standard. Ready to render your institution any services, whenever occasions may arise, I remain regardfully your</p>
