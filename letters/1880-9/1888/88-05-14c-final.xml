               <seg style="">Some time ago a generous and thoughtful settler wrote to me on his own impulse about the great success, which attended the rearing of the genuine "Coapim-grass" on his estate, and as I anticipate that this marvellous plant, as it is called in Fiji, where also it was first introduced by me, seems destined to transform even arid sandy tracts of the Australian interior into rich permanent pastures throughout the seasons, I should regard it as a particular favour if you and your honoured colleagues of other Australian journals would kindly induce other squatters and rural estate owners to report through the local public press on any successes they may have had with the Coapim. Indeed it would be very encouraging to me, if these favorable results with this plant and indeed also with the two larger "Burr-clovers without burrs," the "Teosinte Giant Grass," the "Carob tree" and other plants of high pastural interest, of which I distributed seeds often and copiously, were rendered publicly known, as moreover by these means numerous other colonists, particularly those in the farthest interior, would profit. May I avail myself also of this opportunity, to repeat a solicitation, made through your valuable journal before,</seg>

Thus I would be able to advance during what little time merciful divine providence may destine the continuation of my worldly career, the elaboration of the rich Flora of Australia towards completion.</seg>
