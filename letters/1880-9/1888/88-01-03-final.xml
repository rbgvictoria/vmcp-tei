                     <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>Favenc was proposing to explore an area east of Geraldton, WA. His letter was discussed at a meeting of the Council of the Victorian Branch of the Royal Geographical Society of Ausralasia on 10 January 1888, the discussion being reported in <seg style="font-style: italic; ">Australasian</seg>, 14 January 1888, p. 36. A sub-group of the Council met on 14 February, supported Walter Cuthbertson as a surveyor who had been successful in that role during the Society's expedition to Mt Obree in New Guinea, and decided to make a grant to Favenc, who was required to make arrangements with Cuthbertson himself (M to A. Macdonald, 14 February 1888). Applications for the post of Surveyor had been made by Norman Taylor (N. Taylor to M, 17 January 1888) and, in an undated letter to Favenc, by Siegmund Israel, who had arrived in Australia from Germany on 26 January claiming to be an experienced explorer, and whom M had advised to contact Favenc directly (A36, papers of Royal Geographical Society of Australasia, Victorian Branch, Mitchell Library, State Library of New South Wales, Sydney). Despite a report in the <seg style="font-style: italic; ">Age</seg> (Mebourne), 14 February 1888, p. 5, that '<seg style="">Favenc will be accompanied on this trip as representative of the Royal Geographical Society by Mr. Siegmund Israel, a geologist and botanist, who was lieutenant to Mr. Henry M. Stanley in his second Congo expedition', Cuthbertson accompanied Favenc (see Favenc (1889) and </seg>
