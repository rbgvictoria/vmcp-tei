               </note> of the Herbarium here. The main building, consisting of one large room, was constructed in 1857, under the direction of Captain (now Major-General) Pasley, the then Minister of Public Works for Victoria. The material used for the walls is basalt, the ordinary building material in Melbourne; the roof is constructed of English tiles, rarely seen in use over here, slate being generally adopted for roofing purposes. The cost of the main building was about £1000, but several hundred pounds sterling were expended subsequently for fittings in wood of <name key="Cedrela%20australis">Cedrela australis</name>. Three years ago, when the great Sonderian collection was acquired, an annexe of galvanised iron was added at a cost of a few hundred pounds with further costs for shelves, &amp;c., amounting to several hundred more. The total collection of dried plants comprise now about half a million sheets, each as a rule containing several specimens. My own collections were presented to the public herbarium. I commenced collecting in 1840, and have continued in Australia uninterruptedly since 1847 (till 1853 entirely at my own private expense), and later also with my own means to a not inconsiderable extent.</p>

Thus we have many authentic specimens from Thunberg, Giseke, Ehrhart, and Gouan. In Australian plants the Melbourne collections are by far the richest of any in existence. But South Africa is also particularly well represented, chiefly through Steetz's and Sonder's herbaria; and although the main portion of the South African plants went many years ago from Sonder's herbarium to Stockholm,<note xml:id="ftn8" type="footnote" n="8">
