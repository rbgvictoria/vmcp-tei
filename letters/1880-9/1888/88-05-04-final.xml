                     xml:lang="en">In resolving to recommend that Bevan be granted a reward for his exploratory work in New Guinea, the Council of the Victorian Branch urged that Bevan 'and his party' should be rewarded. The file includes Bevan's letter to Macdonald, with a note: ''Please explain my views to Baron Von Mueller, the Council &amp;c in fact there is <seg style="">
                        <hi rend="underline">no</hi>
                     </seg> necessity to treat this letter as a private communication'. It also includes a letter from Bevan to Edward Strickland, 12 May 1888, in which Bevan makes the same points as here, asking Strickland if he was writing to M to point out to him the difficulties associated with what the Victorian Branch had proposed, and that 'putting such a difficulty in the way of the Imperial authorities is likely to prevent such recommendation having any useful result towards myself'.</p>
