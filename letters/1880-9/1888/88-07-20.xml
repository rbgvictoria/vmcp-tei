               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>Your last letter reached me yesterday. I have posted you some numbers of my paper the Cooktown Courier which I am now editing in the hope that I shall obtain a command of some expedition to New Guinea yet. [Kemp's] Gold find in New Guinea is a glaring lie. He never found the 6oz specimen there. If people go there with him, they will surely rue it, mark my words. As for the Geographical Society's party I have already told you what I think. Now they actually intend to land in the Mai Cussar river where Capt Strachan &amp; his party shot the natives!<note xml:id="ftn4" type="footnote" n="4">

               </note> Did you ever hear of such madness. It is nothing less than suicide. Nothing will come of this expedition except disappointment &amp; waste of money. — If the Melbourne men are so anxious to try the Island for Gold, I shall be glad to lead an expedition for them. I only require two things. Firstly they must pay my wife a certain monthly sum sufficient to keep her in comfort, and secondly I must have a personal interview in Melbourne with the parties and be allowed to inspect &amp; purchase every article which goes with the expedition. I only want two miners &amp; perhaps a geologist might be induced to accompany me. The cost for 8 months would not exceed £1,500 to £2000. The heaviest item would be the trade — tobacco beads, salt, hatchets, chisel irons, etc. My arms must be the best procurable not necessarily for fighting, but in case of accidents.</p>

The natives called it Jari &amp; said there was plenty, but I abstained from writing about it, as I have been so long on gold fields that I fully appreciate the immensity of the crime of causing a rush, anywhere &amp; especially to such a place as I allude to. Not that there is any danger to a small party. I experienced none &amp; will go there again if necessary. Professor Denton was distinctly of opinion that we should find heavy deposits of gold at the junction of the slate and granite. Unfortunately his illness &amp; death frustrated our schemes. We were in black &amp; grey slate, talchose schist, a greasy sort of stuff crossed by numerous veins of Quarts &amp; this formation was <seg style="">
