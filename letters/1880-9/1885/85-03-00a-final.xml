M is most likely referring to Kirchhoff (1886-1907) which, however, never got up to a systematic treatment of 'Australia' in its coverage; the Australian fauna is dealt with only very briefly (vol. 1, pp. 859-60) within a discussion of Wallace's faunal regions.</p>
               </note> but that at his (the Baron's) request Mr Macleay had given permission for the Paper to be read before &amp; published by this Society prior to its transmission to Germany. It was resolved that the best thanks of the Society were due to Baron von Mueller for his very kind and thoughtful action on our behalf: — also that the Paper should be read, and published in our Transactions.<note xml:id="ftn4" type="footnote" n="4">
