Macfarlane; and as the Government here was at once in communication with the authorities of N.S.W., it seemed to us most desirable, to hold a special general meeting of our branch, to report formally to the members these exciting tidings and devise in full meeting any plans, which as a branch of the Society we could adopt here with prospect of success. That meeting took place last evening, and three resolutions, prepared by the Council here, were unanimously adopted, one of sympathy for the party, one of thanks to those who worked for relief, and one urging gathering of funds and if possible to get further votes from the Legislature; the last resolution is the only one, by which we can <seg style="">
