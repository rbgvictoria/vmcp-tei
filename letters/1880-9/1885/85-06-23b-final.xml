                  </p>
               </note> I may be allowed to add, that when the plan of exploring from the Aird-River was finally decided on by telegraphic conference about two months ago, the Council of the Victorian branch of the Geographic Society of Australasia unanimously approved of the gallant leader chosen by the Sydney Exploration Committee for the expedition, a naval gentleman being absolutely required; Captain Everill, moreover, having gained previous particular experience in the Sunda Islands and Polynesia. When as far back as December last, at the geographic conference in Melbourne, the desirability of securing the experienced services of the Rev. J. Chalmers for Papuan explorations was recognised, it was for a land expedition from Port Moresby to the Owen Stanley ranges; but the rev. gentleman could not accept any offer for leading an exploring party into the highlands of south-eastern New Guinea, for which, undoubtedly, he had unrivalled experience, because he had made arrangements, after 18 years of ardent missionary labor, to visit Europe this year. The Australasian Geographic Society was, however, fortunate enough to arrange with Mr. O. Forbes, who has subsidies from the Royal Geographic and other British scientific societies, for becoming also, to some extent, an emissary of our society; and he will now try to ascend the Owen Stanley ranges from Port Moresby, under the advice of the Rev. G. Lawes, and the Rev. J. Chalmers, on a route which probably would have been chosen by the latter, could he have taken the field. All this will be fully made known by the early publication of the transactions of the Society in Sydney.<note xml:id="ftn3" type="footnote" n="3">

               </note> that near Mount Aird other peaks exist, and further inland still higher ranges, trending from west to east. It is, therefore, reasonable to assume that these mountain-chains are connected with the very elevated ranges in south-eastern New Guinea, and thus the expedition under Captain Everill's able command will, in all probability, be able to furnish, not only an accurate account of the flow of the Aird and its tributaries, but will also reach the highlands beyond on an entirely unknown new line. Allow me, Sir, also to point out, that I regard the very various zoologic researches, expected from the Aird Expedition, quite as important as the geologic climate and phytologic enquiries for general science, though geography must also on this occasion reign supreme; and it is a fortunate circumstance that the Sydney Exploration Committee—whose exertions and zeal under Sir Edward Strickland's presidency for the fitting out the expedition with the concurrence in all important points of the Victorian Geographic Council (which has the benefit of Mr. Alex. Macdonald's great ability as honorary Secretary)—was able to secure as experienced a naturalist as Dr. Haacke for the zoologic section of the scientific service.

To provide for each branch of science a strictly professional representative in this first exploit was an impossibility within the comparatively limited means available for the enterprise, which we owe entirely to the generosity of the Governments of New South Wales and Victoria, and we are therefore greatly beholden to the accomplished surgeon, who also embarked in the perils of this mainly geographical enterprise, to bring, irrespective of his medical skill, also his acquaintance with various natural sciences to bear on the furtherance of the expedition.<note xml:id="ftn6" type="footnote" n="6">

I am sure, sir, that we all would deprecate if, at the outset of the expedition, which requires from each member heroic resolution and self-denial, anything should appear in the public prints that would damp their ardour or would be unjust to any of them individually. Let us, therefore, all wish them "A glorious success and safe and triumphant return."</p>
