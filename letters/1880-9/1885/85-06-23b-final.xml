               <space unit="chars" quantity="1"/>I may be allowed to add, that when the plan of exploring from the Aird-River was finally decided on by telegraphic conference about two months ago, the Council of the Victorian branch of the Geographic Society of Australasia unanimously approved of the gallant leader chosen by the Sydney Exploration Committee for the expedition, a naval gentleman being absolutely required; Captain Everill, moreover, having gained previous particular experience in the Sunda Islands and Polynesia. When as far back as December last, at the geographic conference in Melbourne, the desirability of securing the experienced services of the Rev. J. Chalmers for Papuan explorations was recognised, it was for a land expedition from Port Moresby to the Owen Stanley ranges; but the rev. gentleman could not accept any offer for leading an exploring party into the highlands of south-eastern New Guinea, for which, undoubtedly, he had unrivalled experience, because he had made arrangements, after 18 years of ardent missionary labor, to visit Europe this year. The Australasian Geographic Society was, however, fortunate enough to arrange with Mr. O. Forbes,<seg rend="FootnoteReference" style="">

It is, therefore, reasonable to assume that these mountain-chains are connected with the very elevated ranges in south-eastern New Guinea, and thus the expedition under Captain Everill's able command will, in all probability, be able to furnish, not only an accurate account of the flow of the Aird and its tributaries, but will also reach the highlands beyond on an entirely unknown new line. Allow me, Sir, also to point out, that I regard the very various zoologic researches, expected from the Aird Expedition, quite as important as the geologic climate and phytologic enquiries for general science, though geography must also on this occasion reign supreme; and it is a fortunate circumstance that the Sydney Exploration Committee—whose exertions and zeal under Sir Edward Strickland's presidency for the fitting out the expedition with the concurrence in all important points of the Victorian Geographic Council (which has the benefit of Mr. Alex. Macdonald's great ability as honorary Secretary)—was able to secure as experienced a naturalist as Dr. Haacke for the zoologic section of the scientific service.
