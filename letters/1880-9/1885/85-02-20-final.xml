               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>May I encroach on you, dear Sir George, in the interest of an old Adelaide friend, H. Heuzenröder, Esq., who in advanced age and in failing health requests me to ascertain, whether his most extensive numismatic collection could perhaps by purchase find a permanent place in the Museum of the public Library in Melbourne. From 1847 til 1852 had I often occasions, to see this most extensive collection of coins; and at that time already it had become so celebrated in Adelaide, that it was visited on his own accord by the then Governor, Sir Henry Young; altho' the collection was by no means brought under public notice by the proprietor.</p>
            <p rend="letter"
               style="font-family: Geneva; font-size: 12pt; "
               xml:lang="en">
               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>Mr Heuzenröder collected these coins all gradually himself first in Germany and subsequently in Australia for his recreation and own pleasure during more than 50 years, and the time spent on gathering these treasures and in their study has been immense. He spent in cash over £1800 on it gradually; the msc. catalogue extends over 422 folio-pages. — As Mr Heuzenroeder's eyesight has become almost extinct, he is anxious, that this collection, of which he derived such enjoyment through life, should get a safe and appreciative place, and that whatever it fairly can realize should come to the benefit of his family, his youngest son just having matriculated for University studies in Adelaide in a brilliant manner.</p>
            <p rend="letter"
               style="font-family: Geneva; font-size: 12pt; "
               xml:lang="en">
               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>This collection would gladly be secured for the Adelaide-Museum or University, did the present financial state of South Australia admit of the extra vote for this purpose. So the accomplished owner has turned his view in this respect to the great City of Melbourne; and as the commencement has here in the public Library's Museum already been made with the formation of a numismatic collection, it may be worthy of the consideration of the trustees, whether it is better, to secure a well arranged and very extensive collection at once, than to go through the tedious process of gradually forming the collection and that at a finally very much greater expenditure. It is unnecessary to dwell, when speaking to an enlightened board of trustees, on the importance of collections of coins, representing those of all civilized ages, for historic, linguistic, commercial, heraldic and other studies; so I will only add, that in bringing this chance of acquiring a vast collection of great value, before it is lost for Australia, under notice I have personally no interest whatever, whether these masses of selected coins are secured, beyond a continued desire, to contribute in whatever direction I can towards the rise of Australia to a permanently great country.<note xml:id="ftn2" type="footnote" n="2">
