It is introduced by 'We published not long ago an appeal from Baron Mueller to the settlers in our outlying districts asking them to collect for him specimens of the flora around them. The Baron again desires our help in this direction. We cannot do better than reproduce a portion of his letter upon the subject'.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>I ask your aid in advocating the collecting of plants in the inland regions, particularly at the remotest eastern and north-eastern settlements of West Australia. In what little time of my life may be left I am eager to complete the Australian Flora, as far as I can. As the West Australian territory anywhere far away from the coast is not yet carefully searched, ladies and gentlemen might readily distinguish themselves by gathering either in flower or in fruit <seg style="font-style: italic; ">any</seg> kinds of plants near them, for even if the particular species may not be rare they will still be of interest to demonstrate the geographic range in the particular direction of the locality. Most particularly I am anxious to get the minute annuals of Spring <seg style="font-style: italic; ">now</seg> developing. Plants in a dry clime like yours are so very easily prepared for collections, and as the specimens need not be large they could readily be sent by successive mails direct to me. Seeds of grasses, florist flowers, etc., could be sent in exchange. A very simple method of obtaining large collections at each pastoral station far east would be to send out aboriginal youths with baskets to bring in all sorts of plants, for payments in proportion to the variety of sorts obtained, and any moderate outlay for this purpose I would refund.</p>
