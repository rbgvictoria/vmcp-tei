Such horticultural test-stations might also render many kinds of trees, particularly also bamboos and palms, available for scenic embellishments along railway lines, around the Gippsland lakes, and at other favourite places of tourists; and from these stations might also be naturalized with particular ease many kinds of esculent fruits in our ranges; it being anticipated that rabbits will become subdued by the introduction of the least harmful of their natural enemies.</seg>

The advisability of attaching to the principal Government farm a specialist, who could devote his whole time to entomologic and mycologic inquiries into the ever-increasing disease of plants, must be apparent, vegetable pathology requiring the unremitting attention of a professional Government officer now in every country, for commanding a view over the vast current special literature, for carrying on local observations, and for contriving protective measures.</seg>

In this manner, the requisite skilled labour of artisans and the needful costly machinery would become available to a sufficiently large and remunerative extent in adequate places for such operations, as, for instance, pressing various kinds of oils, including that of the olive; for manufacturing sugar and treacle from beet or from sorghum; for preparing different fibres from the most eligible plants, grown even on land not perhaps otherwise readily utilized, among which fibre-plants the New Zealand flax lily, the Agaves, and Yuccas would take a place; for properly treating tobacco-leaves, reared on favorable spots, to realize a superior marketable article; for drying by the most approved recent methods, orchard-fruits, as apples, prunes, figs, currants and raisins, irrespective of many delicious sorts as yet totally unknown here, which could either be consumed or converted into particular preserves and jams; for the culture of many medicinal plants, including cinchonas, in places peculiarly adapted for each; for introducing many additional kinds of vegetables, which would be brought as new fares on our tables; for preparing, by the simplified Indian processes, from the fresh young leaves of the tea-bush, quickly the marketable article; for choosing sumach, scotino and other select tan-plants, to be brought under special culture in adapted localities; for growing the many sorts of scent plants, fit to be distilled or to be subjected to enfleurage, among these the Attar roses and also <name key="Eucalyptus%20citriodora">Eucalyptus citriodora</name> and <name key="Eucalyptus%20Staigeriana">Eucalyptus Staigeriana</name>; for raising particular herbs methodically on special honey-farms; for rearing osiers and bamboos, to keep local basket-makers regularly supplied; for cultivating the hardy arrowroots and other starch plants; for rearing, if even only for hedge-rows, the white mulberry and the best opuntias, so as to be available for the bye-work of silk production and cochineal gathering on farms. On this occasion, I need not speak of the copious raising of the cork-trees, the walnut and hickory-trees, the Valona oak, the best turpentine and resin pines, the hardier gutta-percha and caoutchouc trees, date palms and many other sorts of trees, affording returns only after many years, therefore too late for the wants of pioneer-settlers; much less need I here allude to forestral requirements, which in an adequate and comprehensive manner, can only be dealt with by special State measures.</seg>

               <seg style=""> Since then, the access to the number of colonists conversant in culture and pastoral pursuits has become so great, that many more now than formerly can bring to bear practical experience, gained under different circumstances in various parts of the world. Thus the system of eliciting answers in detail to inquiries would likely be still more telling now than then. In connexion with the Commission's work of that time, several essays on leading cultural plants were issued, the collecting of which anew into one or more volumes, to avoid ephemeral dispersion, may be worthy of consideration.</seg>
