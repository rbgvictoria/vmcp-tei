In France, trees commencing to suffer from the goat moth are (on the original recommendation of the great entomologist, Latreille), surrounded at the stem base with a mixture of clay and cowdung, by which means the larva of the cassus, which are hatched from eggs deposited at the bottom of the stem, are prevented from penetrating the stem. Whether any similar means are of avail, to prevent the large grubs of the eucalyptus moth, endoxyla eucalypti (which bores not only the stems of our blue-gum trees, but also that of some other eucalypts and of our wattle), from getting access to elms, requires to be ascertained. Trees of healthy growth in well-adapted soil would be far less liable to the boring of the endoxyla than sickly trees, planted in more or less unsuitable soil and subject to stagnant moisture at their roots. Lingering blue-gum tees, when bored by the endoxyla, I have often saved by starting them again into vigorous growth through surrounding the base of the stem with an earth seat, covered with sods of Indian couch-grass, it being also necessary under any circumstances to remove old and loose pieces of the outer bark regularly from the stem, to prevent insects from harbouring under such shelter. As the attack on your elms seems a new one here, it would be necessary to initiate experiments as to the best means of protecting these English trees under altered circumstances in this colony. I should like to see a sample of the larva, pupa, and perfect insect destroying your elms there. Some kinds of our eucalyptus are also attacked by beetles, as borers into the wood, the two most formidable, as identified by Mr. French, being Hapatesus nirtus</seg>
