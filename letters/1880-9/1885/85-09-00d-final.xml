                     <seg style="">Aqueous Vegetation.— During the last and preceding season some discussion has taken place respecting the advisability <space unit="chars" quantity="1"/>or otherwise of removing the aqueous vegetation which rises to the surface of the local lagoons at certain periods of the year. Opinions have been divided as to the necessity of such a proceeding. By some it is held that the vegetation is not detrimental to the health of those residing in the vicinity of the lagoons, and others aver tthat it is. At times, when the vegetable matter is decomposing the smell is not particularly attractive; and the Council has decided to obtain an expert opinion on the point. Some years ago the matter was skimmed off the lagoon; and by some residents it is held that the same practice should be followed every year. At the instance of the Mayor three samples of water from the lagoon have been taken. One was taken from a spot where the aqueous weeds are in greatest abundance, the second is from where they do not thrive in such luxuriance, and the third is from a place where there are no weeds at all. When the weeds are plentiful the water is perfectly clear and colourless; where they are not so plentiful the water is slightly cloudy; and where there are no weeds at all the water is of a decidedly milky hue. It is proposed to ask Baron Von Mueller for an opinion on the subject.</seg>
