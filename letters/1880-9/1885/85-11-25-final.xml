               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>Altho' comparatively a stranger to your Excellency, I venture to adress these lines to you, and do this with less hesitation, as it is entirely in the interest of science. I am anxious, to exercise what little influence I may have in this respect for so deserving a scientist, as Dr von Lendenfeld, who for the continuation of his researches on the Medusae, Spongiae, Corals, Actinia and allied animals is mainly relying on the support obtainable from the scientific institutions in your great City, among which the University and Museum are the foremost In both of these your Excellency has taken a leading interest since a long series of years; hence I would plead the cause of so zealous and accomplished a worker so far as to ask, whether some permanent provision on either University or Museum could be made for him. I need hardly mention to one of so high attainments as yourself, that much of the successful progress of any researches depends on ease of mind regarding worldly means, and this applies most particularly to all branches of nature-science. As Sydney has taken charge of nearly the whole of the zoology of Australia hitherto, I feel sure, that the great facilities for studies of the Australian Fauna will also in future be maintained there. — For further accumulating and elaborating material of Evertebrata, no one could be found, who in eagerness and earnestness of purpose and in early gained experience could be surpassed by Dr von Lendenfeld anywhere; and it would be to the renown of the colony and for the advancement of truly scientific objects, if he was placed in the best possible position for the display of his energy and learning. If therefore your Excellency would kindly bring your extensive influence to bear for the furtherance of Dr von Lendenfeld's studies in a position, which frees him more from the cares of providing for a young family, your favor would be bestowed on a worthy son of science.</p>
