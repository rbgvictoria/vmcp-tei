               </note> I am often very sorry that my worldly means are so narrow and that my scientific relations all over the world involve so many pecuniary sacrifices, that I can do very little for the comfort of my own household, and thus also so little for anyone of yours there. I keep not even a single horse and only one man and a servant, yet it is impossible in such a position as mine to save anything, especially as the numerous charities of so great a city as Melbourne put us all here under such endless contributions. Let me hope that you are all happy and well. Health is next to a good conscience, the greatest treasure in the world unless family love.</p>
