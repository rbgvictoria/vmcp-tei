Much as has been done in the past — and everyone will acknowledge the large share Baron von Mueller has had in the undertaking — there still remains work which can be done better by residents in a locality than by travelling collectors. At the present time, after the favourable season we have experienced, there are probably many species of minute annuals in fruit and seeding which have not been seen for years, and may disappear again till another good season gives them a chance of flowering and fruiting. It is impossible for travellers to be in all places at the best opportunities; but residents, who have given a little attention to the subject, could gather a rare harvest. </seg>

                  <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>What chemists, or their assistants or apprentices, can do, is to make a collection of all plants, large or minute, occurring in their district or at any place within reach. The specimens should have branch, leaf, and flower always; wherever possible, fruit or seed-vessel must be included, and it is advisable where there is a long interval between flowering and the ripening of fruit, to secure a second specimen later in the season. In the case of all small plants the roots should be shown as well. These specimens should at once be numbered, and it would be as well to adopt a system of labelling, something like the following : —</seg>

The specimens of each plant should be in duplicate, and should be kept quite distinct; they had better be placed loosely in a folded sheet of paper. </seg>
