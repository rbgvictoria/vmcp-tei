The text given here is from 'The Californian thistle', <seg style="font-style: italic; ">Camperdown chronicle</seg>, 11 December 1886, p. 3 (B86.12.03). At a meeting of the Hampden Shire Council on 1 December 1886, a discussion was held about the presence of the Californian Thistle in the district. ‘Cr. Lang affirmed that he had been very careful in the enquiries he had made with regard to the Canadian thistle before making the matter public, knowing what a serious matter it was to landowners generally.’ He had sent a specimen to a number of gentlemen (including the Editor of the <seg style="font-style: italic; ">Australasian</seg> and the Secretary of the Ballarat Agricultural Society), and all had declared it to be the Canadian thistle. ‘After the statement from the secretary he would certainly send a specimen of the thistle to Baron Von Mueller, and have his opinion as a skilled botanist.’ … ‘Cr. Lang said he would take care to obtain Baron Von Mueller’s opinion regarding the thistle’ (<seg style="font-style: italic; ">Camperdown chronicle</seg>, 4 December 1886, p. 2). On receiving M’s reply, Lang wrote to the editor of the <seg style="font-style: italic; ">Camperdown chronicle</seg>: ‘Baron Von Mueller, the Government Botanist, declares that our thistle is not the <seg style="font-style: italic; ">Carduus Arvensus</seg>. I enclose a copy of his letter, from which it will be seen that it was from the same source that the Secretary of Agriculture derived the information which he recently communicated to the shire secretary on the subject. Let us be thankful that we have, apparently, as yet, in this shire, escaped an invasion from the dreaded perennial. The scare we have had may be attended with good results, and let us note that the thistle with the long name, already so plentiful, is one against which it is declared, on the Baron’s authority, “measures should be taken.” The great difficulty with it will be its early seeding. It blooms in September and October, when every-one is engaged in the wool harvest. … I think you will agree with me that I am entitled to call upon the editor of the “Australasian” to explain how he gave the reply which he did when I consulted him about it.’</p>
