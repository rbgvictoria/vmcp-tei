'Student' criticized the illustrations for having been used before and for not being of common plants. 'I do not deny that the illustrations are of value to the advanced botanist, but that is not what was wanted. It was desired, I believe, to have a text book in the simplest possible form that the Baron would condescend to write it, and illustrated by representations which any of the elder children in our state schools would recognise at a glance ... It is a sad disappointment to some who had looked forward to having a thoroughly practical key, but after reading the Baron's <seg style="font-style: italic; ">Botanic Teachings</seg> [B77.08.01] and <seg style="font-style: italic; ">School Botany</seg> [?B79.06.04] neither of which works has, I believe, been a success as a generally useful educational work, it was, perhaps, too much to hope for better things for the key. ... It is a remarkable fact that, out of the 152 illustrations, no less than 67 represent plants which the Baron was the first to describe, so that the well-known initials "F.v.M." become a weariness to the eye. The Baron seems to be so much in love with those plants, of which he is, so to speak, the godfather that he had selected them, rather than plants which we may all find easily, as illustrations for a text-book for botanical beginners.'

When I look at almost any text book of botany, I find the plants figured are almost invariably those which are the most easy to be obtained.' 'Student' drew attention to Lindley's <seg style="font-style: italic; ">School botany </seg>(Lindley (1862)), Balfour's <seg style="font-style: italic; ">Manual</seg> (J. Balfour (1875)) and the <seg style="font-style: italic; ">Manual</seg> by the lecturer at Heriot-Watt College, Edinburgh, Robert Brown (1874), as examples. 'Instead of selecting for the woodcuts — (Why will the baron insist upon calling them "Xylographs"?) — plants which every child could find on its walk to school in the country, the illustrations, as a rule, represent the rarest specimens of our flora. ... Part 2 in its present form will be almost useless in the field to a beginner, as he will so rarely find figured the plant which he is striving to identify. As a supplemental volume, to be kept on the shelf for occasional reference, Part 2 will no doubt be of service, but beyond this I am too ignorant to perceive its merits. I see clearly that it will be necessary for some practical man to publish a useful series of illustrations after Part 1 makes its appearance. ... I believe that photography might be used in the illustrations, and that the cost might be thereby lessened. ... "Part 2." principally paste and scissors, bears too evident marks of hurried work. The baron speaks of some omissions. I could point out four myself.' (<seg style="font-style: italic; ">Argus</seg>, 10 September 1886).</p>

Referring to 'Student's' first letter, Dattari suggested that the keys in Spicer's <seg style="font-style: italic; ">Handbook of the Plants of Tasmania</seg> were misleading and contradictory. 'Moreover, the Tasmanian key is not of any use to beginners, but only for advanced botanists, who, knowing the peculiar character of the orders and genera, may perhaps by that artificial method discover the name of the plant. In reference to the woodcuts, I think the Baron quite justified in illustrating some of the plants not to be found near Melbourne, as the key is intended for the use of the whole colony of Victoria, and not for a portion thereof' (<seg style="font-style: italic; ">Argus</seg>, 13 September 1886).</p>

He took a copy into the <seg style="font-style: italic; ">Argus</seg> office and spoke to a sub-editor: 'On entering his room I saw, to my delight, a pot of fuchsia in flower on his mantelpiece, and I asked him if he would like to be made a botanist in five minutes. He very courteously fell in with my views, and, making him use Spicer's book himself, he traced his fuchsia to the order, Onagreæ, to which it belonged.' 'Student' held to the view that M's choice of woodcuts was poor, asserting that Dattari has misunderstood the criticisms made. 'Mr. Dattari has just as much right to express his opinion as I have to express mine, and I must leave it to the Chief Secretary and the intelligent public to decide which opinion is entitled to the greater weight. ... I am not without a gleam of hope that the baron himself may be convinced, by the plain arguments which you have allowed me to make public, to cancel Part 2 and re-cast it upon less scientific but more commonsense grounds.'
