Indeed for the last 12 months I could find no time for any of the meetings of the two medical Societies here, for the microscopic Society, the litterary Assoc. of the W. Melb Presb Church whose Patron I am, the Liedertafel and any other local Unions, with which I am connected except the geographic Society, whose exploratory measures are intimately connected with the interests of my Department.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>You are aware, and you and your honored colleagues will approve of my view, that the Duties of a President of any scientific organisation should not merely be nominal, but that he ought, as has been the case in your Club for some years, extensively and actively identify himself with your work. For this I see no prospect on my part during 1886 and perhaps 1887, without setting aside the completion of the "Key" and other urgently needed publications as the daily routine work of the Department takes up most of my time already.</p>
