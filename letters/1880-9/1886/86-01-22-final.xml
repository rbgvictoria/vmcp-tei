The text given here is from the report of the speech on New Guinea on 3 February 1886 at a meeting of the Federal Council in Hobart by James Dickson, a delegate of the Government of Queensland in which he was the Treasurer (<seg style="font-style: italic; ">Mercury</seg> [Hobart], 4 February 1886, p. 4) (B86.02.06).

                     <seg style="">The Royal Geographical Society of Australasia has recently sent an exploring party to New Guinea, the expenses of which were contributed by Victoria, New South Wales, and South Australia. That expedition was absent for several months, and has recently returned and reported the progress they made in the exploration of the interior. Baron von Mueller, who has taken a very prominent part in the exploration of Australia generally, has expressed a desire to have the position of the society brought before this Council. With regard to Queensland, the benefits accruing from the expedition are deemed very questionable. It has not been considered an unqualified success, and it is considered that a great deal more information has been obtained from the efforts of private traders, and through the missionaries who have been carrying on for many years excellent work on this unknown island. I will take this opportunity of reading a letter which I have received from Baron Von Mueller, in which he solicits that the matter shall be made public before the Council, and although …, no practical outcome can result, being a matter of finance which is beyond the scope of our functions, it will give me the opportunity of gratifying the Baron's wish if I read his communication, which is as follows:</seg>—‘.</p>

               <seg style=""> the zealous secretary of the Victorian branch of the Australian Geographical Society, and I think I cannot do better than forward this note to you, especially as the Hon James Service and the Hon. Graham Berry are likely to bring the desirability of further united action of the Australian Governments for the promotion of geographic researches before the Federal Council. Had I been able to see you in Melbourne, I would have probably pleaded this cause with you, but as you are so favourable yourself to the furtherance of exploration, you are sure to give it your support in the present Federal deliberations. It would be very important that Captain Everill's talent and experience be further utilised for expeditions in New Guinea, and perhaps some provision might be created for this able seaman</seg>

Your great colony, in the early exploring of which I took an active share, and whose interests geographically and otherwise scientifically I have always endeavoured to advance since very many years, is so very much interested in the opening up of New Guinea for commerce and culture, that your honoured colleague is certain to support also the extension of colonisation and enterprises connected therewith in that direction.
