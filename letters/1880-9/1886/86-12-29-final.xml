The next meeting was held on 17 February, at which Ernest Giles read a paper entitled 'Past explorations in Central Australia and suggestions for further explorations north and west'. In addition, J. F. Roberts 'read notes on a recent tour through New Caledonia', while papers by W. Sayers and J. Banner [Bulmer? — see M to A. Macdonald, 4 January 1887] were postponed until the next meeting (<seg style="font-style: italic; ">Argus</seg>, 18 February 1887, p. 3). As a result of the hiatus in the publication of the Victorian Branch's <seg style="font-style: italic; ">Transactions</seg>, none of these papers was ever published.</p>

               </note> we will have to make some strenuous efforts in our branch also with advancing the antartic cause, ere the season gets too far advanced for next summers work. Could we have fortnightly meetings? My room would be always at the disposal of the joint Committee, and my dwelling is near two omnibus-lines. We might sometimes also meet at your place, if your kind Lady's household is not too much disturbed thereby. I am sure, there will be always be work every alternate week, to carry the antarctic proposition timely through.</p>
