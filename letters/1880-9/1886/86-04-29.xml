We told him this when he came amongst us — again we were met by excuses plausible but foolish, in which he skilfully tried to prove that he was not to blame — as a matter of fact, the proof was at once corrected by one of our Council, and I myself worked anxiously to get the report printed — Several applications had been made for it, by the various authorities of Australia and by the various branches of our Society</p>

Australia or Western nevertheless it shall be made as a "pis aller" — We have discussed the question very carefully and thoroughly, whilst smarting excessively under the hardship of being burdened with heavy responsibilities incurred in the performance of a special and important duty for the benefit of the state — Even though we had failed in our performance we should have felt it unjust that punishment in any shape should be allowed to visit us, but when it is a matter of notoriety that we performed the duty well, and much to the advantage of Colonial interests of Geographical and scientific Interests always at a great personal sacrifice of time and labour, we do find it very hard to bear a punishment instead of a reward for our good public services — and again it should be remembered that, at a considerable cost to the Society a large and most instructive collection of curios from New Guinea was splendidly arranged and was visited by thousands during the Xmas holidays <seg style="">
