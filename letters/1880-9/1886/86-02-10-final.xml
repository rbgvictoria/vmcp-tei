               <space unit="chars" quantity="1"/>— Such a compliment from the first scientist of Australia, and the most renowned botanist of the day ought indeed to have been acknowledged as respectfully and as quickly as possible — Let me beg of you to pardon me, for<space unit="chars" quantity="1"/>reasons I will immediately give you, and now accept my very grateful and sincere thanks for the honor you have done me — I shall long bear it in mind — your kindness has awakened up afresh within me deep regrets that I was unable to take my place at your recent very interesting meetings, at all events to hear your learned and very admirable address —<space unit="chars" quantity="1"/>I have not only read it, but I have studied and it is indeed a very grand paper. I have been ever so glad to see Pasco and his companion, but they seemed bent<space unit="chars" quantity="1"/>upon excursions in which I cannot just now accompany them — and this very much to my regret — my colleagues are made of such queer stuff that I fail even to get them to come and dine with me to meet them — They are hard working, extremely domestic men. Personally I have done my best to return in some small degree the honor and hospitality you all show to us when we visit your great Capital. — of late I have had deep anxieties here and painful troubles at home and I have been absent up the country to sell some property — Thank god I have been successful and as soon as ever I can get away I shall be off for a holiday — As though to complete my troubles, the Society is unfortunately now quite a thorn in my side — We are short of Cash by nearly £300 and as yet we have failed to melt the hearts of the Govt. Eventually I hope we shall succeed in getting money in from the Govt and from private sources. There has been no mismanagement, as our accounts will prove — The deficiency has arisen from the large sums spent by Everill at Thursday Island and Queensland, both going and returning and the small amount realized by sale of extra stores and food supplies — also the cost of preparing our exhibition which we gave gratis to the Public during the Xmass and New Years holidays astounded<space unit="chars" quantity="1"/>us by its extravagance — of course we shall get out of the trouble but just now it is depressing and very annoying to me.
