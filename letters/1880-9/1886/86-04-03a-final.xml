               </note> which reached me by the last mail. I have come down here to arrange about getting stores transported to my camp, and making final arrangements for the journey to Mount Owen Stanley, whither I am to be accompanied by the Rev. J. Chalmers. We start on the 6th. Mr. Hennesy, my assistant, has left me, and I have the entire charge of all the different departments of work and of triangulation. The growth of the herbarium has given me great satisfaction, and I hope will prove interesting to you. The bulk of the specimens are from great trees, most of which have been felled by the axe. l have a considerable collection of woods also. I feel, after getting through the dreary wet season with my men and myself, greatly acclimatised. I have got an accurate basis and commencent<note xml:id="ftn3" type="footnote" n="3">

               </note> of a map on the scale of l in. to a mile, the making of which has given me great pleasure. The region of my camp is already completed, but I had hoped to carry it beyond Owen Stanley during the dry season. This must all be given up for want of funds. Sir Peter Scratchley gave me his promise that the work should not be stopped for lack of means. I have given a whole year of unremitting work towards the elucidation of British New Guinea. A mere journey to Mount Owen Stanley, though difficult, does not present insuperable physical difficulties at all—as far as I can judge from a distance: But to spend several months on its height was the only way of getting real knowledge of the country, either orological or geographical. There has been an epidemic—I may call it so—of fever and pleurisy among the natives, both on the coast and in the interior, and transport is almost an impossibility. It has therefore been impossible to send down any herbarium. The whole of my collections will be brought down to the coast on my return from Owen Stanley. I should like to visit Melbourne and Sydney, but I fear I may not be able.<note xml:id="ftn4" type="footnote" n="4">

The date of our quarterly meeting will be fixed accordingly.' The Secretary had previously telegraphed Forbes to enquire whether it would be possible for him to make the expedition a geographical one only, and the cost of that option (<seg style="font-style: italic; ">Argus</seg>, 20 May 1886, p. 5.) Forbes telegraphed his reply: 'Impossible for me to give satisfactory reply to your message without personal interview. After seeing special commissioners for New Guinea I shall leave for New South Wales and Victoria to discuss position personally' (<seg style="font-style: italic; ">Age</seg>, 24 May 1886, p. 5).</p>
