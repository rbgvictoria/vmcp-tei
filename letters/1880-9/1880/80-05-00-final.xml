               </note> he had seen near George's Bay trunks of E. viminalis with streams of so-called Manna adhering to them even to near the base; it was exuding from perforations of the bark, made by Cicada moerens; hundreds of these insects were on the trunk, with their boring organ buried in the bark. This borer is about half an inch long, tubular and very slender, and terminates in a saw, with which they pierce the bark at right angle to their body, the whole length except the short broad base going into the bark; through this apparatus they suck up the sap. They are easily caught when their boring organ is thus buried in the bark, as they cannot withdraw it rapidly. In its larval stage it lives underground, presumably on roots; there also it becomes a pupa, much the same in form as the perfect insect minus the wings. When ready to emerge it comes out of the ground, nearly always in early morning, and ascends the first object it comes across. There it fixes itself by the claws of its frontlegs; the case splits up along its back, and the insect escapes, withdrawing its limbs singly from the enveloping case. The wings in a very short time attain their full dimensions and become of proper consistency, though soft at first, and the insect flies away. [He saw<note xml:id="ftn3" type="footnote" n="3">
