According to his later statement, however, in the introduction to B83.08.01, 'although rather extensive collections were formed’ he was in the Shark Bay area for only two days. M returned to Fremantle on the same steamer from Champion Bay, arriving on 17 November (<seg style="font-style: italic; ">Herald</seg> [Fremantle], 24 November 1877, p. 2). He was John Forrest's guest in Perth, and with him made a 'flying visit' to Northam where he collected seeds of trees (<seg style="font-style: italic; ">Western Australian</seg> [Perth], 7 December 1877, p. 3). On his return journey overland to Albany he spent some time in Bunbury to inspect 2,000 acres of land that he had selected, and decided to reject it as a poor investment when offered a rent of only £2 <seg style="font-style: italic; ">per annum</seg>. He arrived in Albany on 20 December (<seg style="font-style: italic; ">Herald</seg> [Fremantle], 29 December 1877, p. 3), and left on <seg style="font-style: italic; ">Assam</seg> on 29 December, arriving in Melbourne on 4 January 1878 (<seg style="font-style: italic; ">Argus</seg>, 2 January 1878, p. 5, and 5 January, p. 7).
