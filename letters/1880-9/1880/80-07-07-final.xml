As a scientific man, it is impossible not to envy the freedom which he now possesses from all administrative labour. It is to be hoped that some joint arrangement may be arrived at amongst the several colonies to secure his unique herbarium of Australian plants as a permanent public establishment, to be provided with a proper endowment, and to be preserved for all time as a standard of reference in the Southern Hemisphere for the accurate nomenclature of indigenous plants. It is to the credit of Victoria to possess him on her civil establishment, but his scientific services, as an explorer no less than as a scientific botanist, have been rendered to the whole continent, and I observe that the latest of his many publications on the vegetable resources of Australia is a most useful report on the forests of West Australia.</p>

My official position became stultified (which I felt never more keenly than at the approach of the world Exhibition), my little private fortune became wrecked, I lost all hold on Society, have grown ill and dispirited, and the hopes of building up a domesticity were destroyed.
