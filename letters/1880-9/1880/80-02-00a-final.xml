These reports M considered added some credibility to stories that a member of Leichhardt's lost expedition might have survived for some time. The extract is introduced by 'he read the finishing passage of a letter from Mr Du Faur worded thus:â€”.'</p>

He had organized a meeting in Sydney on 16 February 1880, which was poorly attended despite his 'having sent out over fifty MS invitations to it'. He reported that M, 'after reading my letter', asked Sir Thomas Elder for assistance (E. Du Faur to the Editor, 18 February 1880, <seg style="font-style: italic; ">Sydney morning herald</seg>, 20 February 1880, p. 7). For a report of the meeting, see <seg style="font-style: italic; ">Sydney morning herald</seg>, 17 February 1880, p. 5.</p>
