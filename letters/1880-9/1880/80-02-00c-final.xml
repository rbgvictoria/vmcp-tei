               </note> He was found dead in his bed. Although he felt ill the evening before in Albany, he rode back to his place in the country, commenced his work in the morning, and sent a native away on some trivial business only an hour before. He was found to have expired from apoplexy. He had attained the age of seventy-five years. Only two years ago I made long journeys with him over rough country for several days on horseback to collect plants and seeds, and he was then as enthusiastic as ever, being able to endure great fatigue till the last of his bush life. More than thirty years ago he conducted Mr. <seg style="font-variant: small-caps; ">Drummond </seg>through the Stirling ranges in the journey which proved so memorable in the discovery of many splendid plants. He was nearly always in the bush, and engaged in procuring seeds, botanical and entomological specimens, in which pursuit he is succeeded at King George's Sound by Mr. W. <seg style="font-variant: small-caps; ">Webb</seg>.

Encouraged by myself he undertook several extensive journeys over then untrodden ground, eastward as far as the Great Bight, and thus found many new plants, and enabled us to extend the known limits of the range of many rare species, as recorded in the <seg style="font-style: italic; ">Flora Australiensis</seg>.<note xml:id="ftn5" type="footnote" n="5">
