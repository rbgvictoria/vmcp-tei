               <seg style=""> that they are not modified buds either of leaf or flower. On the twig before me the galls are placed unilaterally, with the exception of the lowest of the series. Each gall (dried) is somewhat olivaceous in colour (as in the leaves). Each measures about 10 lines in length, and about 5 in diameter. Each has four strong angular keels externally, which are continued into extraordinary processes about 2½ inches long, and slightly curved at the tips; occasionally one of these processes is absorbed or abbreviated, and in one instance a tendency to furcate is shown. They are extremely hard, and the walls are quite a line in thickness, and when cut a very strong odour, like that of intensified Black Currant, is very evident. The artist who drew the specimen pronounced the odour to be that of Black Currant </seg>

Baron von Mueller extracted larvae from some similar galls, and forwarded them in fluid. They are lepidopterous. A well-grown larva is about an inch in length, pinky-whitish in colour, somewhat semi-transparent, and without markings, save that there are black dots on the spiracular region, independent of the black spiracles themselves; the head is pale, castaneous. There (fig. 97) are eight ventral (in addition to the anal) prolegs.]</seg>
