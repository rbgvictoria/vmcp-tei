What I did get, was a mere nothing or at least very little indeed of dried plants; but as I had from him before some small sendings, which he sent without any monetary engagement then to me, I passed £20 - - for the whole as the fullest fair value for what I received. Thus £30 are still left at Mr Goldies disposal to collect &amp; dry plants for me, which he could do so easily, even if he only gathered coast <seg style="">
