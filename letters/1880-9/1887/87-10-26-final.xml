If any shortcomings towards yourself occurred in our transactions with you, then be so just to remember, that we have not a single man of leisure on our Council, that in the stern duties of daily life we might overlook details in connection with our honorary work for the R.G.S.A., and that a single letter to us, asking plainly, what in justice to yourself required to be done, would have been better, especially as we gave you half a thousand £, when<note xml:id="ftn4" type="footnote" n="4">

That we, after being unable, to provide the £2000, asked by you for highland-exploration, made other arrangements for an expedition within our means, arose from our desire not to loose the season, while at least one other expedition was proceeding to New Guinea; — and that the Rev. J. Chalmers, to whom alone I had pledged myself in the choice for the leadership, was not waited for, arose from an expression of the then last letter from the Rev.

               </note> In fairness to us here you will allow me to remind you, that every readiness was shown here by us, to support any Expedition of yours under the auspices of the High Commissioner and therefore on the expense of the Australian Colonies additionally so far, as to purchase a series of any specimens from such expedition at the highest price, that according to value could be placed on them. That you should have recently stated, no specimens of plants should ever be sent to me any more by you, I cannot think to be correct, because it would be unfair to me as the one, who for a dozen years urged highland exploration in New Guinea, — because it would be ungrateful to me as the one, who mainly advocated the former grant to you, — and because it would cause here public discontentedness. I frankly concede, that you have cause to be disappointed in not having yet received more names of your former and only sending, not quite as many species as you publicly stated; but I had no idea that the dichotomous method, demanded for the "Key to the system of Victorian plants",<note xml:id="ftn7" type="footnote" n="7">
