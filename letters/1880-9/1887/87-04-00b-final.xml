Doubtless his close application to chemical work brought about the ailment to which he succumbed. He gave also some time, on my suggestion, to investigate products of native plants, and thus furnished some of the essential oils for the Victorian Exhibition of 1862, and the London Exhibition of 1863.

His eldest son is a highly-accomplished medical practitioner at Mount Gambier, being a F.R.C.S. of London. His second son continues the renowned pharmacy. For about two years Mr. Johnson’s health had not been good. He suffered from weakness of the heart and bronchitis, and about six months ago the former became so aggravated that he had to take to his bed. He never recovered sufficiently to leave the house, and</seg>
