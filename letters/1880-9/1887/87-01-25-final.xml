               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>As you so thoughtfully ask for suggestions, how collecting of plants during the Survey Expeditions might be made most valuable for science, I would beg to observe, that the aim should be, to get together <seg style="">
                  <hi rend="underline">as many different</hi>
               </seg> species as ever possible; the minutest plants count for science-purposes as much as the largest, the insignificantly looking as much as the showy. Then <seg style="">
                  <hi rend="underline">fruiting</hi>
               </seg> specimens are as valuable as flowering ones, and often more so. Waterplants should also be included; indeed from regions, not yet carefully traversed by Botanists, <seg style="">
                  <hi rend="underline">any</hi>
               </seg> kind of plant is valuable for record of locality. To expedite drying plants, put into sheets of papers, they (plants and paper) should be spread in thin sets on the air, and the sets occasionally <seg style="">
                  <hi rend="underline">halved</hi>
               </seg>, which brings the wet inside outside, and dry outside inside quickly. On Sundays the specimens (so far as dry) can be closely packed, to get much of the paper empty again and each parcel be kept by itself, probably not too large to be sent by successive mails.</p>
