In his letter to the editor, C. A. Macan of Warragul wrote: ‘I have been patiently waiting the result of Mr. Kendal’s experiments towards effecting a cure, or enlightening the public with reference to the horse sent down from Warragul by Mr. Lusado badly affected with the so-called stringhalt. As scientific discoveries are not alone confined to professional men, I confidently expect some intelligent and observant layman to solve this stringhalt difficulty, and prescribe a cure as well as point the cause. The flat-weed theory I cannot myself accept, especially when I know that both sheep and cattle thrive upon it without becoming affected in any way. I have spoken to practical men who agree with me in this. I lately sent a specimen to Baron von Mueller asking its botanical and medicinal properties. He writes:—‘.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>The plant, which here received the name ‘flat-weed,’ and which in your district and other parts proved hurtful to horses, is botanically known as ‘<name key="Hypochaeris%20radicata">Hypochaeris radicata</name>.’ It is indigenous in Europe, Western Asia, Northern Africa, in Britain very common. The medieval physicians ascribed to it medicinal properties, and drew it thus much into therapeutic (curative) use, though it has in recent times not received attention in this respect. No injurious effect seems to have been observed as caused by this herb in Britain, so far as I am aware. […]<note xml:id="ftn2" type="footnote" n="2">

I would suggest that £5 a piece be offered by all the agricultural societies in Victoria as a premium to anyone who will in an intelligent and comprehensive manner explain the nature of this epidemic, and by certified test cure one or more badly-affected animals; £100 paid away in this way would be public money well spent. The remedy would, of course, be <seg style="font-style: italic; ">pro bono publico</seg>. In Gippsland, I am sure, many breeders would gladly supplement the amount, and make it £200 if they could get a cure.’</p>
