James Chalmers will be actively identified with the expedition, so that his great local field-experience and his influence over the aborigines may be brought to bear on the expedition. The Council further begs to point out, that if during this year good results should occur from explorations in the highlands of British New Guinea, the chances of a new vote for 1890 from the Victorian legislature for continuing these researches, would be much increased.</p>
