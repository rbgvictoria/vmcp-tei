               </note> Indeed inexpressibly do I feel touched by this condescendence of the greatest forum of science, — all actions of which are surrounded by a halo of plurisecular renown, — to connect my humble name as a link in the chain of glory, unitedly formed from among the leaders of progressive thought through these brilliant awards. This grand mark of consideration, shown me by you, Sir, who occupies the most exalted place in British Science, and by your celebrated Colleagues, is in its value to me still further enhanced by the circumstance, that this is the first time, at which an Australian name became enrolled among those of the illustrious Elite, successively singled out for this ever glorious distinction in the world of knowledge; thus also at the verge of the first century for colonisation of the fifth continent, Australian researches become still more encouragingly recognized at the eldest centre of learning in the great British Empire.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/> I am however conscious, that this unsurpassable gift is not won by me through what I may have endeavoured to accomplish by individual exertions, but that it rather should be considered as a recognition<seg style="font-weight: bold; "> </seg>of bravery, shown through a whole century by science-votaries in these great Australian dominions of her Majesty, — I merely happening to be one of their seniors. Undoubtedly this graceful act of the Royal Society — let us say — towards all Australia will have here a long lasting and immensely cheering effect on science-work in our next secular epoch! In the late autumn of my life, after multitudes of science-honors, — I fear but scantily deserved — have been almost showered on me, I shall always feel anew elevated by this grandest prize of all, and it will inspire me to new endeavours and stimulate me into increased exertions for contributing to the cognizanze of God's wondrous world for the benefit of mankind through such time, as the grace of divine providence may yet allot to my worldly career.</p>
