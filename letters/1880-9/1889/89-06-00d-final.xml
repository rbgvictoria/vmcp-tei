Such crisp specimens would come in small bundles, cross-tied, readily by post. I can resoak them here to prepare them on paper. Of course if any one will float the delicate or the gelatinous sorts out on paper, all the better. From time to time I could send you £5 by post-office money order, so that adequate payment, according to results, could be rendered to the gatherers. Not only would new sorts of algs be likely to be found, but it would then also become ascertained, whether the oceanic plants of W.A. reach as far north as Champion Bay; also, whether any tropical sea-weeds come down so far south. Perhaps your kind lady has friends in other coast places further north, who could be induced to collect sea-weeds and indeed oceanic grasses too, Professor Harvey not having come further north for his local studies than Swan River.<note xml:id="ftn5" type="footnote" n="5">
