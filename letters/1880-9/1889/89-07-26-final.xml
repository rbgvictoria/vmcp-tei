               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>About twelve months ago this branch recognising in our Australasian Society the absence of a stimulating influence for the reward of meritorious labours &amp; the encouragement of latent talent which would in no way limit individual operations, &amp;, observing that although our learned colleagues representing our sister branches had, in conference assembled, adopted no active means to make such provision further than mere reference thereto, also observing no practical &amp; united efforts by individual or collective branches in that direction, unanimously adopted a resolution at its annual meeting then held, providing for this want. This resolution, which also invited united action &amp; solicited an expression of opinion from our sister branches, was subsequently forwarded to them for their respective consideration. Our Sydney branch acknowledged the receipt &amp; promised attention by its Council. Our Adelaide confreres never acknowledged that nor any subsequent communication, a circumstance which indicates inactivity. Our learned colleagues of the Melbourne branch with their characteristic courtesy duly acknowledged receipt by letter dated August 10. 1888.<note xml:id="ftn3" type="footnote" n="3">

In response to Thomson's complaint about being confronted with a <seg style="font-style: italic; ">fait accompli</seg> in regard to the issuing of membership diplomas, Macdonald said he had 'merely suggested the advisability of your Council adopting a form of <seg style="">
                        <hi rend="underline">Certificate</hi>
                     </seg>, which is quite different from a Diploma of Fellowship'.</p>
