               </note> at which the question of the height of some of the tallest Tasmanian trees had been discussed, he had been making inquiries by circular on the subject and had received some replies of value thereon. He intended to have a paper on this subject at a future meeting of the Society. Baron Von Müeller had written on this subject asking him to mention at this meeting that he (Baron Von Mueller) had never made himself responsible for measurements of 400ft. in height of any eucalyptus trees, and that in nearly all his writings on this subject he gave the names of those on whose statements he had relied too hastily in reference to exaggerated data concerning the supposed exceptional heights of certain eucalyptus. In the <seg style="font-style: italic; ">Argus</seg> of May 25 last he had set forth some of the best information obtainable, and urged new measurements of trees in Tasmania and West Australia.<note xml:id="ftn3" type="footnote" n="3">

               </note> It would be pleasing if the Tasmanian members of the Australian Association for the Advancement of Science, who will attend the Melbourne meeting to be held in the early part of next year, could furnish for the biological section genuine measurements of Tasmania's tallest trees, or trustworthly records of past discoveries in this direction. He further suggested that an officer from the Survey Department should visit the group discovered by Mr. C. Barkley at Mount Barrow to obtain reliable data on the height of these trees.]</p>
