               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>I have the honor to report, that Mr G. Renner, one of the Assistants in the botanic Museum, is again ill, a certificate to that effect being attached from the medical Gentleman, attending him.<note xml:id="ftn1" type="footnote" n="1">
                  <p rend="Footnote"
                     style="font-family: Geneva; margin-left: 0.3346in; margin-right: 0in; text-indent: -0.3346in; font-size: 9pt; "
                     xml:lang="en">See G. Renner to M, 20 March 1889 (in this edition as 89-03-20a). The medical certificate, dated 19 March 1889, was signed by J. O. Eccles, M.D., 96 Collins Street East, Melbourne. It stated that 'Mr Renner is suffering from severe nervous exhaustion and I am of the opinion that absolute rest from his duties is necessary to ensure his recovery &amp; change of scene will also probably be of considerable benefit to him'.</p>
               </note> I may again remark, that his work is of the most easy kind, that he lives in the Museum at a very healthy spot therefore, that he is never through duties exposed to the inclemency of weather, and that his ailing cannot arise from any cause, due to his departmental position. I have now the honor to solicit, that it may be left to my discretion, to see what can be done under the circumstances, as I cannot state as yet how long he may require to be away, and what will be his place of stay. At all events I beg, that he be allowed to be away for some days, and that his absense now be counted, should he ask for ordinary furlong later on.<note xml:id="ftn2" type="footnote" n="2">

                     xml:lang="en">The minutes on the file show that on 27 March 1889 H. Moors, for the Under Secretary, asked M to 'furnish a report as to the sick leave granted to Mr Renner during the past five years. The accompanying form can be used for the purpose.' M replied on 3 April: 'Report furnished in the form desired.' See M to H. Moors, 3 April 1889 (in this edition as 89-04-03a). The Under Secretary, T. Wilson, then submitted the form on 5 April, noting: 'I cannot under the circumstances recommend that any further sick leave be granted. I would suggest that Mr Renner be directed to at once return to duty.' The Chief Secretary, A. Deakin, endorsed Wilson's suggestion on 8 April and the file was forwarded to M for his information.</p>

                     <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>On 9 April M noted on the file: 'Mr Renner presented himself at the Office on Sunday last, the 7th inst, having come from Broadford [Vic], to consult his medical attendent. He was then somewhat better, but felt yet unable to resume duties, and then returned again to Broadford. As he has reported him self, since I first wrote, I have in the mean while instructed him, to return as soon as ever possible to the Office, and keep me informed of any change in his stay, should such be required. I trust that this will meet with the approval of the Hon the C.S.'</p>

                     <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>Wilson modified his instructions on 12 April, noting on the file that ‘Mr. Renner should either return to duty at once or send in a medical certificate as to the nature of his illness &amp; the probable length of time it will be before he can resume work'. On 13 April M added a note: 'Though not stating so fully in my minute of the 9th April [see above], I wrote on the same day to Mr Renner [letter not found], that if he could not very soon return, it would be necessary for him to produce a further medical certificate to that effect, and to request his physician's opinion, how long his illness would likely last. A letter from Mr Renner, just got, is appended'; see G. Renner to M, 11 April 1889 (in this edition as 89-04-11a). Renner obtained the further medical certificate required and submitted it on 15 April 1889 (see G. Renner to M, 15 April 1889). He finally returned to duty on 23 April; see G. Renner to M, 23 April 1889.</p>
