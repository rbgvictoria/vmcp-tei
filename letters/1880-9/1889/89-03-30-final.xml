               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>As the time is approaching when Departmental Estimates have to be submitted for the finance-year 1889-1890, I have the honor to point out, that some improvement in the status and in the salaries of the Staff of the Gov. Botanists Department may be worthy of kind consideration. On comparison of the expenditure, thus far incurred, with that of other Departments, it will be noticed, that the payments to the employees in the Establishment, under my control, have always been singularly moderate and in my opinion hardly adequate. I would therefore venture to suggest some improvements in the position of most of the Officers in this Establishment on the next estimates.</p>
            <p rend="letter"

               xml:lang="en">
               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>Mr. G. Luehmann held for 20 years a prominent position in the Office of the Gov. Botanist, requiring high education, and has acquired thus also special knowledge. He has had for the last five years without any increment £300. -. - annually, and unless promoted will remain at £325.- .- for the next five years. He is now 45 years of age. If this worthy Officer could be promoted to the third class, he would — and very deservedly so — commence with a Salary of £360.- .-.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>Mr. Ch. French, senior, has been engaged in the Gov. Service for the past 24 years uninterruptedly. For his position as Senior Assistant in the botanic Museum the particular knowledge, which he possesses, is requisite. He is not even yet in the clerical division of the service, though his duties need from him frequent or rather constant clerical-work. He will attain, unless promoted, his maximum salary next year at £252.- .-. If he was raised to the fourth Class of the clerical Division, he would have an increase of £10.- .- annually up to £300, — after that £25 at intervals of five years. His age is now 46 years.</p>

Could he be promoted to Class 5 of the clerical division, he would receive an increment of £20.- .- annually, til he reaches £200 as a years salary. During the 10 years of his service he gained special experience, the exercise of which is more worth than his present income. He is now 29 years old.</p>

               </note> has as third Assistant been now 5 years in this branch of the public service. Should his position remain unimproved, he would only yet receive £84.- .- for the next finance-year; and could never gain more than £96 a year. I would therefore recommend, that on the new estimates he be placed in the 5th class of the clerical division, his duties necessitating writing work almost continually. Although as yet only 20 years of age, his zealous application to duty render his well entitled to the suggested promotion. As the total annual monetary difference, to improve the position of these four officers, will be inconsiderable, I trust, that this solicitation on their behalf will meet with favorable consideration. Finally I would beg of the additions of two youths to the Staff of this establishment, one at 4/ and one at 3/ a day, for the future, — as the work, as well in the Museum as in the Office, is constantly increasing, and as such youths at small payment could do much work for which otherwise higher pay must be rendered.<note xml:id="ftn2" type="footnote" n="2">
