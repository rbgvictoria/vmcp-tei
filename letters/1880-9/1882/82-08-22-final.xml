               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>Since some time I have been anxious to bring under the notice of the trustees of the General Cemetery a subject, which in my opinion needs consideration, but which in all probability was never brought before yourself and your honored Colleagues.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>On all occasions, when I was among those, who paid the last homage to a departed friend, by following his mortal remains to the place of interment, I was feeling, that the solemnity of the moment, when the coffin is sunk into the grave, was impaired by the utter want of a becoming dress of the workmen, who aid in sinking the Coffin into its place. The dress of the men I noticed often torn, neither clean nor exhibiting a vestige of mourning. Indeed it seemed, that the men appear in exactly the clothing, which they wear, while engaged in the labor of sinking the hole. Now, doubtless, the poor men are not in the position out of slender wages, to provide a fitting dress, while appearing in front of the mourners; but I am sure, the trustees would not willingly see anything done under their direction, which might hurt the feelings of those, who spend always freely for Coffin-decorant and emblems of Mourning, all of which as a rule is beautiful and often gorgeous; but in what miserable contrast to all this is the dress of the workmen, who sink the magnificent casing, the floral wreaths &amp;c into the grave? I am convinced, that each family, to whom the sorrowful occasion arises, of conveying one of those, dear to them, to a last resting place, would willingly pay the few shillings extra, which would cover their share of the expense, were it incurred, to provide a change of dress to the grave-labourers, while the Coffin is in their hands, especially as a simple Calico Gown of black color and black Calico trousers would merely be needed for the short while of receiving the Coffin. I felt painfully this short-coming for a long time past, but never so much as on the occasion of the funeral of Sir Redmond Barry the hon. Rob. Ramsay and the Rev. John Stobbs.<seg rend="FootnoteReference" style="">
