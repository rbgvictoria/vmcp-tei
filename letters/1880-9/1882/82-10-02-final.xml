I gave him free passage all over the group in Government vessels, store room for his boxes &amp; collection — free quarters at several places which he visited, and did everything I could to help a young Botanist who I sensed was not overburdened with money But he never showed me a single thing that he collected, nor said 'thank you' for the trouble I had taken about him In short he seemed to consider himself injured because I was not disposed to pay all his expenses while in Fiji</p>
