               </note> Indeed it is one of the very richest ever formed by a private Gentleman, and its historic value consists in the exceedingly large number of <seg style="">

               </seg> connected with published works. this authentic material reaching back to the earlier part of this century, when Dr Sonder commenced his interchanges with aged botanists. Numerically the collection comprises very many thousand of <seg style="">

               </seg>, and each of them is represented by a series of specimens indicative of the geographic range and forms of varieties, thus the whole forms a huge mass of specimens, and would constitute a magnificent supplement to what I have gathered myself since 42 years.</p>

If you deemed it desirable, the Sonderian collection could be put into the Exhibition-building, and I could go occasionally to see to its proper keeping, for which one youth would suffice; hence but very little annual expense incurred for maintenance.</p>
