               </note> efforts were made by some Gentlemen of benevolent disposition to raise sufficient fund for the passage of the Paolini family to Italy, but these endeavours were not attended with success, and it is therefore all the more deserving of grateful acknowledgment that this work of particular charity towards people, who as foreigners had so little claim on your benignity was brought to such a happy issue.

The Ladies' Benevolent Society also appealed for help to meet the then shortfall of £30 in a letter to the editor dated 4 May (<seg style="font-style: italic; ">Argus</seg>, 5 May 1882, p. 6), and the <seg style="font-style: italic; ">Argus</seg> appealed for the remaining £12 (<seg style="font-style: italic; ">Argus</seg>, 19 May 1882, p. 6).
