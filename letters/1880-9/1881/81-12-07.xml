               </note> I have not been able to reach them, I made arrangements for doing so but unfortunately the day appointed for the purpose set in wet and ended in a heavy flood, so that there was no possibility of getting to them just then. I have since been down to Mr Coombes at North West Bay — who I mentioned before, had informed me of the gums being found on the Sandfly, but he was confined to his bed and could not accompany me. but from enquiries made I have no doubt of their existance as stated, especially as they brought home a specimen with them when they first observed the trees. They describe the trees as being from 20 to 30 ft high with a diameter of 8 in to 1 ft, one plant they noticed was fully 40 ft high with a diameter of 16 or 18 inches. There were a great number of trees one of which they cut down and took specimens, but the only one they had left is the one I now send marked from Sandfly. They have since met with it in the vicinity of North West Bay — The Sandfly and North West Bay districts are contiguous</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>There is a Clump of 3 or 4 dozen plants growing on the New Huon Road, about four miles from Hobart, near what is known as the Red House. It is from one of these plants that I obtained the bark sent by this post for the most part the plants are from 4 to 8 inches in diameter with a height of from 8 to 20 ft, upright in growth with but few branches. I noticed when taking the bark that the sap was very sweet, very like sugar and water. With reference to these trees I would add that they are growing at an elevation of from 14 to 16 hundred feet above sea level. The plants from which the first specimens were sent are not more than 600 ft above sea level and come into flower much earlier than those at the higher level, the flowers are also larger and more showey.</p>
