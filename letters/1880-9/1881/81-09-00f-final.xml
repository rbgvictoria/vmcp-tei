               </note> it is desirable to obtain additional collections of plants in a pressed and dried state, particularly from districts far inland or recently settled. It is an important aim by these means to trace out the exact geographic limits of the many thousand species, which constitute the original Vegetation of Australia, in order also that all observations on their respective utilitarian value, whether for pastoral culture, medical or industrial purposes, may become recognized and applicable to the widest extent. Moreover it is necessary to study still further the degrees of variability, to which all kinds of plants are more or less subject, with a final view of circumscribing the exact characteristics of each species. It is to be impressed on those, who may feel interested in the promotion of such researches, not to exclude from local collections any plants, merely because they appear frequent or insignificant. The process of drying plants for permanent collectons is simple and easy in the extreme, it needs hardly any explanation, beyond perhaps the remark, that the parcels of paper, containing any recently gathered plants, after a few hours' pressure, should be divided into thin sets, and be spread out on a dry or warm place, to facilitate and to speed the exsiccation, and to lessen also the requirements of shifting plants from paper, which became moist, into dry paper. Small plants should be gathered with the roots, and all not merely in flower but in fruit also, as indeed from the latter generally the main characteristics are derived. Water-weeds, rushes, sedges, mosses, lichens, fungs (and on the seacoast also algs), even if ever so small, should not be passed in collecting. Transits are best effected early after the preparation of the specimens, in small parcels closely packed, by successive mails. Whoever wishes to become scientifically acquainted with the native plants of his vicinity or of localities otherwise accessible to him, can obtain the specific names, if a duplicate set is retained, in which the specimens are numbered correspondingly to those of the transmitted set. The names of finders of rare or new plants are always recorded in the phytographic volumes of the writer, when specimens are transmitted to him.<note xml:id="ftn3" type="footnote" n="3">

               </note> An intimate knowledge of the indigenous vegetation, while it largely indicates climatic and geologic circumstances, tends also to afford an insight not only into the natural vegetative resources of any tract of a country, but also into much of the pastoral or cultural capabilities of the respective localities. Researches of these kinds become furthermore the sources of educational works, and unfold to well-trained and intelligent minds pure recreative and healthful pleasures, inexpensively everywhere within reach.</p>
