'Sandal House', the three-bedroom property on Albert Park Road that M was renting, when advertised to be sold by auction on 18 June 1879 was 'let to Baron von Mueller at the net annual rental of £100' (<seg style="font-style: italic; ">Argus</seg>, 14 June 1879, p. 2); this is consistent with M's report in M to J.

As a scientific man, it is impossible not to envy the freedom which he now possesses from all administrative labour. It is to be hoped that some joint arrangement may be arrived at amongst the several colonies to secure his unique herbarium of Australian plants as a permanent public establishment, to be provided with a proper endowment, and to be preserved for all time as a standard of reference in the Southern Hemisphere for the accurate nomenclature of indigenous plants. It is to the credit of Victoria to possess him upon her civil establishment, but his services as an explorer, no less than as a scientific botanist, have been rendered to the whole continent and I observe that the latest of his many publications on the vegetable resources of Australia is a most useful report on the forests of West Australia.</seg>
