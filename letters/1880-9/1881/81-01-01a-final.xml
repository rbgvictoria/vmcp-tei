Of course we can stop at any time the phytographic work, of which Victoria was rather proud, and let other colonies get the adscendency. But that from a Victorian does not evince enlightened statesmanship and every high minded man should set himself against such crude notions. Selwyn was driven out of Victoria to Canada, where he is now glorified, while the geologic work of our colony here was stopped.<note xml:id="ftn6" type="footnote" n="6">

What I had as income &amp; private property I have cheerfully spent on my bot. service, but a salary represents only a small fraction of departmental endowment, of which at the slightest reflection you will be cognisant at Kew. Nominally my salary may be equal to that of such illustrious men as Owen, Hooker &amp; Huxley. But who in the whole world would compare a Victorian emolument to one in Britain? The most ordinary vitals may in retail be cheaper here than in England, but rent and nearly everything else is so very much dearer, that it is useless to institute comparisons of this kind; this would however say, that the positions of your leading men of science are monetary much undervalued. In my own case remember, that I have not even an office room left, and that for a series of years £120 annually had to be paid out of my Salary for office rent!</p>
