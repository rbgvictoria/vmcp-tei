               </note> Though in the course of an uninterrupted stay during more than a third of a century in this part of the world it fell to my lot, to promote and even call forth the researches of many geographic explorers, and though I had occasion to share personally in scientific travels through much country previously unknown, including the greater portion of the Australian Alps, — yet I feel, that the special tribute paid me at so grand a forum of geographic science, as that which assembled under your leadership in Venice, is due more to the feelings of generosity of your highly illustrious colleague, than to achievements, which I would wish to have been far more extensive and brilliant. Among the honors, bestowed on me so graciously by the scientific world through several decennia, this special approbation of my efforts expressed by the assembled geographers in the ancient island-city is to me as touching and encouraging as it is unique in my life. Let me cherish an earnest desire, to promote new efforts for shedding additional light on the vast Australian territory, which mainly during my own colonial career I saw disclosed to geography, to civilisation and to settlement. It is a sublime feeling, to enjoy the privilege of contributing to the world's knowledge and especially to widen the realms of geography, within which on new areas human industry and happiness are to dwell! Through feelings of this kind I can appreciate the enthusiastic zeal, with which the united Italian Empire under the aegis of your enlightened Sovereign and of the Italian Royal Princes and under the auspices of the geographic Society of Rome strives to carry the Italian flag to the remotest southern polar regions for the completion of the <seg style="font-style: italic; ">map of the world</seg>,<note xml:id="ftn3" type="footnote" n="3">
