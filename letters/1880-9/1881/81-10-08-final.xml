You are a Physician yourself, and will agree, that only by a plan like this so valuable a life as that of your Mycologic Officer can be much prolonged, relapses being after any early resumption of arduous study-work almost inavoidable. Of Dr Cooke's private affairs I know nothing, as it was only a year or two ago, when Berkeley at his venerable age referred me to Cooke. Like most real son's of science (unless they had property by inheritage) Cooke is probably poor &amp; may have a family to support. If financial obstacles stand in the way I will pay £10 or £20 towards his expenses, for which help he might send some of his spare specimens obtained in Central America. Others of his scientific friends would doubtless do the same, and so a few hundred £ might be got together for him.</p>
