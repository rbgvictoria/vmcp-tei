This sending was the first sign of thoughts regarding me for 3 Governments mails, 3 having passed without my hearing of you or Mr Dyer. I do not think, that so long a break in the Kew-correspondence or Kew communications did occur since I took office under Mr Latrobe, except when in the earlier years I was out on long exploring-expeditions. However I myself did neither write much lately, though I never missed any mail, to send something, and manifested also in other ways my continued loyalty to Kew. That I was not in the spirit of writing much, you will understand, when I say, that for more than 3 months this winter I was not able to leave the sickroom on account of my severe cough, though I continued to keep til midnight's hours on the writing table.</p>
