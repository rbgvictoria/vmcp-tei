               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>I have the honour to inform you that I have examined the three samples of diseased vines submitted by you yesterday on behalf of the president and committee of the Victorian Vinegrowers' Association. I find that as regards two of the samples, the damage is due to the well- known oidium mildew, which about a dozen years ago invaded our colony, and has been hurtful in many localities to our grape harvest ever-since. <space unit="chars" quantity="1"/>The third specimen—the one without berries—shows red spots on the leaves, originating probably from stagnant humidity about the roots, or perhaps from very exceptional weather influences. At all events, I have not succeeded to make out any definite fungareous growth on the scant material received, and believe the particular colouration due to cellular atony in some of the leaf substance from impaired nutrition. It would be well if better specimens of the foliage, and also portions of the root, were procured and forwarded carefully in a small case for further examination, the samples this time received having much suffered In transit. So far as I can judge from the material before me at present no new alarm need arise, because the vine oidium, as well known, can he subdued by the liberal and well directed use of sublimated or powdered sulphur, carefully dusted by bellows or whitening brush over vines affected by oidium, this sulphuring to be done early in the season over the young foliage, and subsequently also over the flowers, buds, and later over the young fruit; or the vines may be freed of this mildew by syringing with a weak solution of hydrosulphide of lime, which liquid should also be applied to stem and branches after pruning time. Moreover, dropping leaves and prunings of vines infested with oidium, as indeed with any other disease should, in all instances, be burnt, as often insisted on before, which means would much tend to diminish ­any fungus on vines, to which they will be more or less subject, so long us spores will he wafted anew from any infected place through the air, and this may be from long distances, particularly in windy, warm weather. It may be as well to mention also on this occasion that a vigilant circumspectness should be exercised in preventing the introduction and spreading of another fungus peculiar to the vines, namely the peronospora vititola,<note xml:id="ftn2" type="footnote" n="2">
