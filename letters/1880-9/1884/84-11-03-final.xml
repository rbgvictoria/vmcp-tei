                     xml:lang="en">Scortechini in a letter to J. Hooker (f. 247) dated Thaiping [i.e. Taiping, Perak] 9 April 1885 thanked Hooker for his letter, which ‘found me out in the thick jungle of Perak ... could not answer it immediately because I was far from any regular postal communication, and because my writing material was exhausted ... you will be pleased to hear that for two years more I shall remain here collecting and studying.’ The date of Hooker’s letter is not mentioned but it is probably the one referred to in the annotation, though Scortechini did not mention M in this letter. On 12 June 1885 (f. 248) he wrote from Perak, Straits Settlement, ‘your kind note 27th Feb. reached me only a few days ago, evidently being delayed ... Baron von Mueller was complaining that he never got from me some novelties for our joint collaboration, so to easy [<seg style="font-style: italic; ">sic</seg>] off some material I have sent to him descriptions and specimens of several new plants’. From Straits Settlements, Perak, on 9 July 1885 (f. 249), Scortechini wrote ‘Yours of the 18th of May just at hand ... Sir Hugh Low shortly is expected to be back and to him I shall submit your very kind offer to send the collection to Kew for safe keeping.’ From Thaiping on 12 August 1885 (f. 251), he wrote: ‘yours of June the 26th just at hand. By this same mail I despatched ... specimens of what I described as Pseudo-Eugenia ... I have sent others to Beccari and Baron von Mueller by last mail ... I would gladly have sent to Kew some specimens of the species which I have described and published as new, only I was afraid of giving you too much trouble. As you have kindly made me the offer of your assistance in comparing specimens with authentic ones kept at Kew, with pleasure I shall accept it ... I would have sent several ... things which ... I sent off to be published, had it not been for a certain delicacy I felt.' The letter is annotated in Joseph Hooker's hand: 'Eugenia skiophila, Duthie'. See Scortechini (1885).</p>
