               <seg style="">, of which you forwarded some fruiting branchlets, is regarded as a native of Madeira, but it may be originally a South American plant; it became naturalized in various of the warmer regions of the globe, and it is likely to spread also gradually through Australia in spontaneous growth, as the seeds from scattered berries would readily germinate wherever carried casually about. It is therefore important that some warning of the deleterious properties of this plant should be given after you establish the poisonous effect of the berries, particularly so, as the bright colour of the latter would be enticing to children.</seg>

As you justly observe the effect of the pulp of the Solanum berry may be less harmful than that of the seeds; but on this point no careful observations are extant, so far as I am aware. Spasmodic affections, particularly of the voluntary muscles, are observed to be caused also by other solanaceous plants; thus jerking and convulsions are produced by the action, in advanced stages, of <name key="Belladonna">Belladonna</name>, Stramonium, <name key="Hyoscyamus">Hyoscyamus</name> and even <name key="Dulcamara">Dulcamara</name>. The dilatation of pupils, noticed in your case, is also in accord with the effect of various other <name key="Solanaceae">Solanaceae</name>. Under these circumstances there can be no doubt that the poison case recorded by you arose really from the particular Solanum under notice, and I can therefore much encourage you to give publicity to this case.</seg>
