               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>When it was decided by the Imperial Horticultural Society of St Petersburg, that an international Exhibition was to be held for the promotion of Horticulture in that city, I was requested on his own spontaneous impulse by the Vice-President of the Society (of which since many years I am an honorary member) to participate in this cosmopolitan show as an exhibitor. Having been mainly instrumental in initiating through other European Exhibitions and botanic Gardens the since years extensive export of ferntrees on a mercantile scale from Victoria, I thought that if I brought a <name key="Todea">Todea</name>-fern of enormous size and more than a hundred years age before the horticultural world at such a splendid occasion, I would also open up a demand for these much rarer ferns, which admit of wide transits in a living state, and would thereby create or much enlarge a trade in <name key="Todea">Todea</name>s from Victoria; but if I had not been distinctly asked, I should not have exhibited on account of the expense involved. When I found, that the expenditure of conveying the monster-stem, which without fronds and without case weighed 4000 lb, from the Ranges to Melbourne and thence to London, amounted already to such a considerable sum, I had no courage to submit this account for the transit of the Giant-<name key="Todea">Todea</name> from London to St. Petersburg, but defrayed it myself, having on very many other occasions through many years borne similar expenses in the interest of the resources of Victoria and for the advancement of science. In exhibiting on this occasion as Gov. Botanist of Victoria it was done on behalf of the Colony, just as will be the case with other Gov. Botanists of other countries, for instance Sir Joseph Hooker, K.C.S.I., of Kew; and it has always hitherto been left to us here or elsewhere, to act at our discretion as professional Gentlemen in dealing departmentally with such really routine-matters.</p>
