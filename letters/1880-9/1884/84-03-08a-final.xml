               </note> dear Mr Best, was left til now unanswered, because I wished to weigh carefully all that would bear on my obligations, if I became President of the Field Naturalists Club, an honor which indeed I would value highly, and for which you say the Committee wish to nominate me. On two former occasions I found myself prevented from accepting the additional duties,<note xml:id="ftn3" type="footnote" n="3">

               </note> however honorable and gratifying, involved in such a position; to some extent these reasons operate still, particularly as through the acquirement of the Sonderian Collections the Museum-work in my Department will be increasing during many month. But a much graver obstacle has arisen, the impairement of my health. Neither the coast-air, nor the forest-air have subdued my cough; thus I can foresee, that during the coming cool months I shall be unable, to venture out in cool weather particularly at night hours, so that I shall probably be also obliged to relinquish my Vice-Presidency of the Melbourne-Liedertafel. I do not think it right, to occupy a post of high honor, such as the Committee of the Field-Naturalists Club wishes me to fill, without participating with some regularity and efficiency in the work. Had my health remained firm, I would have waived all considerations, and would gratefully have responded to the call made on me; but as I am still suffering from bronchial inflammation of more than ordinary extensiveness and obstinacy, I feel, that I must remain as retired as ever possible for a long time to come, avoid speaking, even, and give to my mind, which has been overworked for years, more rest. This all would militate against my leadership in so large and important organization of science like that of yours; and I beg therefore, that the Committee will nominate an other Gentleman for the coming 12 months. Should then Divine providence have granted me recovery, I will place myself at your disposal for such services as I may be able to render, if the Club til then should continue the kind feeling evinced towards me.<note xml:id="ftn4" type="footnote" n="4">
