Whatever proceeds thus may arise, I direct to be deposited in Government Saving-Banks with a view, that the proceeds of the Capital be given annually to my sister, Mrs Dr Wehl near Millicent, South-Australia, and after her death to her heirs and those of my late sister, Mrs George Doughty of Mount Gambier, but without any right whatever of any of such heirs to sell the benefit of such annual interest. From the investments above indicated is however to be set apart the sum of one hundred £, the interest of which is to be devoted to protect my burial place, and to keep it continually neat and planted with flowers.<note xml:id="ftn11" type="footnote" n="11">
