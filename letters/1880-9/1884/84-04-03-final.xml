               </note> I further forward a literal translation of that letter. I regret however, that I cannot furnish a copy of the letter, in which I announced to Dr von Regel, that I had chosen a huge Todea for exemplification of the Victorian vegetable resources at the St. Petersburg Exhibition. This inability of furnishing a copy of the letter is readily explained by the fact, that none of my correspondence with great men of science since 30 years, is copied, nor do I ever get letters which have been copied from Sir Joseph Hooker, Dr von Regel or others, our correspondence counting by thousands of letters a year. But I beg to send a transcript from the Departmental letter-book of the letter of advise, which accompanied the Todea or announced its shipment to Mess. Watson &amp; Scull, which is a full and permanent record departmentally of this sending. I add a late letter from Sir Joseph Hooker,<note xml:id="ftn3" type="footnote" n="3">

M. the Czar having taken place in May 1883. That I endeavour, to give due praise to the liberality of the Victorian Government will be seen from Dr v. Regel's letter, and in further support of this I add a cut from the "Sydney Mail", in which I had lately to refer to some medical questions concerning Eucalypts.<note xml:id="ftn4" type="footnote" n="4">

                     <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>On 30 April, the Premier, J. Service, deliberated: 'I regret to say that there are serious irregularities in this matter to which I must request the attention of the Hon. the Chief Secretary. 1. This presentation has been made by the Gov. Botanist to the Russian Govt without the slightest authorisation by the Vicn Govt. 2. The Govt has been, entirely without its consent, made a party to a mutual arrangement for the sharing of the cost between the Govt &amp; the Baron von Mueller. I consider this an undignified position for the Govt to occupy at any rate one in which it should not have been placed without being consulted. 3. But this present, costing to the Govt £32.15.0 is acknowledged in the Despatch as the present of Baron von Mueller. Now this must either be a misapprehension, or else Baron von Mueller has presented as his own gift what was really Govt property. To settle this point I applied for a copy of the letter under which the presentation was made. The Government Botanist however is unable to produce a copy, and must therefore be held responsible for the form in which the acknowledgement is made. The circumstance that a copy of the letter making the presentation is not on record is itself confirmation — as, if the present had been made officially on behalf of this Govt, a copy of the letter should of course be on record. I would suggest to the Honorable the Chief Secretary, that the Govt Botanist should be informed that the Government entirely disapprove of his action in this matter. The incident confirms the propriety of the Circular issued in last June requesting that all official presentations should be made through the Premier.'</p>

                     <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>On 5 May 1884 Wilson informed Thomas that he had been directed to reply that: 'the attention of the Government Botanist has already been drawn to the impropriety and irregularity of the course he took in this matter'. Thomas replied on 14 May that he had been directed to state that: 'what is dealt with is merely the irregularity of incurring expenditure without authority. The subsequent correspondence has brought to light these further points, namely:— 1. Presenting to the Russian Govt, the property of the Victorian Govt without any authority. 2. Presenting it as <seg style="">
                        <hi rend="underline">his own gift</hi>
                     </seg> notwithstanding that it was paid for out of Govt Funds. 3. Communicating with the Russian Govt otherwise than through the Head of his own Govt. 4. Making the Govt a party, without its consent, to a mutual arrangement by which the Govt is put in quite a subordinate position to himself. As however the Premier's Circular on the subject of Presentations will probably prevent such a transaction in future, Mr Service does not desire to pursue this matter further if the Hon. the Chief Secretary thinks it better not to do so.'</p>
