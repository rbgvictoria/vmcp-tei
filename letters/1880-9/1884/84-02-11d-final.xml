               <seg style=""> But there is a wide difference between not being aware of records and setting them designedly aside, and if Dr. Ross intends to attribute the latter course to me he does me a very deep injustice. In perfect candour, I frankly confess that I was not aware of Dr. Ross's important observations, brought under notice as far back as 1870, through the Sydney Medical Gazette (at a time when grave sorrows harassed my mind), to the effect that eucalyptus applications exercised such a marvellous antiseptic and healing influence on wounds; in fact (let me say, to my own discredit) I had never any regular and ready access to the former Sydney medical periodical, nor have I the slightest recollection of Dr. Ross's observations on the curative use made by our Autocthones of the eucalyptus foliage being in any way brought under my notice, as such a fact would likely have impressed itself vividly on my memory, though in a scientific correspondence, ranging annually from 2000 to 3000 letters, some data might pass perhaps from my collection. Let me assure Dr. Ross of my patriotic rejoicing that the honour reverts to Australia of establishing first of all the value of eucalypts in surgery, as his observations date from 1864, whereas the first real medical data on eucalypts, those by Drs. Trietany and Trixidor on the antipyretic value of the foliage of these trees, were published in 1865, and the surgical observations concerning eucalypts by French and other European professors somewhat later. May I venture to suggest that the original article of 1864 bearing on this subject should be republished for the sake of publicly establishing priority, as well as any subsequent observations by which Dr. Ross may have followed up his discovery. In justice to all concerned and in furtherance of medical science, I trust that what little I wrote— ill at the time— in the Sydney Medical Gazette will induce any physicians and surgeons who gained accurate experience on the therapeutic value of our many kinds of eucalypts to place on record their prior observations on the subject, and to bring any new data obtained by them before the medical profession on so powerful, extensive, and safe, yet still so much disregarded therapeutic agencies.—</seg>
