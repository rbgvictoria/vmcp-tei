The latter shows forcibly how rain deserts lands that have been deprived of forests. Baron von Mueller has presented the valuable book to a friend in Cooma, also a letter from which we have permission to make the follow tracts (</seg>

Cooper's edited collection of M's papers exists in two versions, but only the smaller edition, E. Cooper (1876), contains both Cooper's lecture and a reprint of B71.07.02. <space unit="chars" quantity="1"/>M's 'friend in Cooma' was probably Wilhelm Bäuerlen; see W.

                  <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>I have sent a little book this day for your kind acceptance. The Bombala and Delegate district is hardly at all yet searched for plants, so that numerous species would be new for locality there, and all be recorded in my works under the author's name. Perhaps teachers, during their vacation time, would investigate the flora there, and send successively small parcels of dried plants (either in flower or fruit) by post. If a numbered set was retained by them, they would receive from me the respective names for all species forwarded. I should be willing to pay some money if any intelligent youth, who has an eye for differences of plants, and would be handy in drying specimens, liked to earn a little money in this manner during spring. The Government of the Argentine republic wants seeds of the Riverina saltbushes, and I should like to spend a few £ if I could get a good lot of saltbush seeds of the best pastoral species.</seg>
