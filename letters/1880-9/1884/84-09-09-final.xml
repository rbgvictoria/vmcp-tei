I feel that this generous mark of honour is but poorly deserved by what little I have hitherto done, to aid in rural developments throughout your beautiful islands; and I must regard this splendid gift rather as an encouragement in further efforts, to promote cultural interest there. In this, I shall feel all the more interested, when I reflect, how benignly my little help has there been considered, how intelligently cultural pursuits are followed up in your kingdom, and how grandly rural affairs can be carried out in your serene clime.</p>
