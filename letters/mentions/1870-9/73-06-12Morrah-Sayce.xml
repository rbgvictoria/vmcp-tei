               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>I am to point out that it had become necessary to make permanent arrangements from the fact that your having informed Mr Casey that you did not consider your temporary acceptance of the Office, involved the retention by you of your Office after 30th June, instant, and from your having asked that your salary should be increased to £800 per annum, if the Government desired to retain your services after that date. — Although compliance with that demand was declined, and the demand subsequently withdrawn, it remained incumbent on the Government to make arrangements for the permanent management of the Parks and Gardens.</p>
