               </seg> is concerned, he is no worse off than I am under Ayrton, in respect of whom I am at open rebellion, having refused obedience and informed Mr. Gladstone of it. I have been up before a Committee of the Cabinet, into whose hands Mr. Gladstone put the whole affair, consisting of Lord Ripon, Lord Halifax and Mr. Cardwell, who are entirely in my favor, as is Mr. Lowe and the Treasury — but it is a case for Mr. G. to act in, he alone can, and he seems to be utterly fascinated by Mr. Ayrton. What will come of it all I cannot conceive. The whole affair has become Club gossip, and I have great difficulty in keeping it from being brought before the House, which would just prevent Mr. G. from doing anything at all. Lord Derby has written for details — Sir J. Lubbock has all the correspondence and will ask the question in the House whenever I say the word. On every account I want to keep the matter quiet. For three months Mr. G. buoyed me up with the assurance that "a plan was under the consideration of the Govt. that would effectually relieve me" — but this all of a sudden broke down, how or why I know not. I believe it was a Bill to have removed Kew from the O. of Works. I then threatened to appeal to the House, and this brough out the Committee of the Cabinet, which has made its report to Mr. G., and there the matter rests. I hope that Lord D. will be prudent, his action is wholly spontaneous.</p>
