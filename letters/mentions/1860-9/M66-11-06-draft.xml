               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>My Will is in the hands of my dear friend Dr Walter Irvine MD 32 Park St Bath. England. Therefore if anything should happen to me, you will know where to apply. I shall be 59 on the next 6 June. Since I have been here from last March I have been miserable &amp; unhappy. I should be happy if I could get back to Melbourne, can you give me anything connected with the Exhibition. I can keep at [writing] &amp; [...] Accounts from [...] [...] Night. Can you spare me a Catalogue and an engraving of the Exhibition Building. I look upon Melbourne, the same as my Birth Place. Most likely I shall leave the remainder of the £2000 [provided] I can find employment, to <seg style="">
                  <hi rend="underline">Parties</hi>
               </seg>, and other Institutions in Melbourne. Can you give me any letters of Introduction to any people here. You have known me as a resident and a Brother Mason I hope and trust that you are as active &amp; in good health as when I last saw you at the Exhibition of 1863. All I want is, that I may have employment for my mind, or even for my hands. Pray do give me something to do with your Exhibition. I now conclude my Dear Sir &amp; Brother, wishing you health and happiness for many years to come. Can you get me anything to do under Dr Muller in looking after the Birds, Animals &amp;c. I should then be in my glory, amongst Birds &amp; Animals. Or at any of the Parks. Bring me to Melbourne. <seg style="">
