My learned friend Dr. F. Mueller has kindly determined this species for me, and he also informs me that the little indigo, which I had supposed to be a distinct species, is a mere variety of I. Australis.</p>

               xml:lang="en">One of the most interesting plants from the Darling Downs is Stenochilus maculatus, or the native fuchsia. The name designates the narrowness of the lip in the corolla, by which peculiarity it is distinguished from some allied genera; but I believe that Dr. Mueller proposes to unite the genus with that of Eremophila. A good idea of these flowers may be formed from Dr. Mueller's elegant lithogram of E. bignoiflora (Pl. 55), and also those of E. Latrobii and E. Woollsiana, which are figured and described in the first volume of the "Fragmenta Phytographiae Australiae."</p>

               </note> Society, assisted by Dr. F. Mueller, is now engaged in preparing the "Flora Australiensis," and that any specimens of uncommon or interesting shrubs and trees will be most acceptable to those distinguished botanists. Labouring as they are for the good of these colonies by endeavouring to develop the vegetable resources of this vast continent, and make them known throughout the civilised world, the learned editors of our "Flora" have every claim upon the sympathy and co-operation of the colonists; and perhaps I may be permitted to mention from personal experience, with a view of exciting the energies of others, that any little assistance which is rendered to these indefatigable labourers will be promptly and politely acknowledged.</p>
