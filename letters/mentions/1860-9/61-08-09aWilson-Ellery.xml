               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>In consequence of a […] I heard from Captain Kay some days since &amp; from Mr [Vernon] yesterday, I went yesterday afternoon to the site of the new observatory to see for myself Dr Müeller's doings. A double row of trees forming an avenue is planted quite up to, and abutting on the very centre of the south boundary of the Observatory ground, and the [stakes] for the continuation of it fixed across our ground and continued down to the entrance gate near Prince's bridge. The walk passes within a very few feet of the […] spot where we marked out the building for the observatory.<note xml:id="ftn1" type="footnote" n="1">

                  </p>
               </note> The trees are actually planted up to within three feet of our boundary and the line is marked out across our ground, and yet Dr Mueller had the unparallelled impudence to tell me that he intended the walk to run round the end of our ground &amp; thus resume its own line on the opposite side. His purpose however is obvious. Either to drive away the observatory altogether, or, failing that, to make it appear as much as possible an obstruction to the public. To make it seem as if we had built it across an established public walk. It is clear at all events that we shall experience from him every opposition that his influence &amp; unscrupulousness can bring to bear. I think therefore that it will be […] for us to entertain the question of altering our boundaries at all, &amp; therefore we must put our building as near to the <seg style="">
                  <hi rend="underline">centre of our ground</hi>
               </seg> as we can. When the site <seg style="">
                  <hi rend="underline">O</hi>
               </seg> was marked out, you will recollect that it was [pushed] eastwards to the very extreme that was admissable; in hope of changing our land from ABCD to EFGH.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>I think now it will be better to move it as far <seg style="">
                  <hi rend="underline">westwards</hi>
               </seg> as we can consistently with the meridian passing east of the botanical museum. Also if anything can be done to fence in our ground <seg style="">
                  <hi rend="underline">at once</hi>
               </seg> it should be done. It will never do for us to allow the footpath to be planted &amp; made &amp; then to come in and block it up. I shall be glad however to have a talk with you on the subject. I will call at the Survey Office to day a little before two, and if you are in town to day I hope you will meet me then. I will also try to see Verdon about it.</p>
