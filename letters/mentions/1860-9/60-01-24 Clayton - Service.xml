The [...] or saw thistle grows chiefly on cultivated lands during the absence of crop and can be readily kept under by the use of the horse roller. The [...] or scotch thistle is kept greatly in check in England by the aid of the Goldfinch which feeds on the seeds of this plant during the seeding season this bird gathers in large flocks in those parts of the country where this thistle most abounds. I think, therefore the introduction of this bird in large numbers into this Colony would greatly aid to free us from this thistle. In 1846 the Estate of Lord Holland was covered with this plant and in two years I succeeded by the following means in causing its entire disappearance from his Lordship's park lands. A man was employed to use this kind of tool to [...]<note xml:id="ftn2" type="footnote" n="2">

The other kind of thistles may be similarly dealt with. The time of year for dealing with this matter should not be confined to a month or two but continued the year through and particularly during the dry season. I therefore hold that the work should be vigourously pushed at once the plants generally at the present season are dominant and can be most effectually acted on, if my services would be acceptable in aiding in carrying out the intention of the Government I shall be glad to be employed for the purpose. I have been recently engaged for the government under the reccommendation of Dr Muller the government Botanist and I have also filled the situation of curator to the Melbourne University botanic Garden and possess every satisfactory reference as to my capability to deal with a matter of this kind I beg to subscribe myself your<note xml:id="ftn3" type="footnote" n="3">
