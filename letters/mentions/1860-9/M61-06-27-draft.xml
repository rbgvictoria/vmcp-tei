               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>In accordance with instructions I proceeded to the Immigration Depot in the Govnt House Res. relative to the selection of a piece of ground for the purpose of grazing the three cows belonging to and for the use of the Immigration Department in Company with Mr Harcourt the Superintendent of the Depot. Dr Muller Esqr. from press of business was prevented from being present, but that Gentleman had on the previous morning informed me of his views on the subject which coincided with Mr Harcourt's and mine own in so far as it related to the piece of ground North of the Depot shewn on attached rough tracing. In order however, to its being enclosed, a new fence is required to be erected on the line AB and the iron fence from C to A will require some alteration all of which Mr Harcourt is [...] to perform. — In the following there was a difference of opinion — Dr. Muller wished a fence to be put up on the line DE in order to give a larger area for the grazing of the cows and also to prevent stray cattle from entering by the Gate F and trespassing on the Reserve, this gate is very frequently left open by the Butchers and Bakers who supply the officers quarters, also by other persons, and by the Gentlemen themselves: Mr Harcourt, however, thought this piece of land of no service, and further that the erection of a fence along this line was open to other objections arising from the Reviews and suggested as a means of meeting the difficulty that some poor man of good character who had lost an arm for instance and incapable of perform[ing] manual labour should be selected and paid at the rate of 2/- [...] Diem for the sole duty of attending to the Gates. I should add that I entirely concur with Mr Harcourt's views in this matter.—</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>With reference to the planting the lagoon and rendering it ornamental Mr Harcourt states that he can at once furnish fifty men from the Depot (who are receiving Govt rations) for this work if Dr Mueller could supply an experienced person as overseer to superintend the work. I think this suggestion of Mr Harcourt's a most excellent one and would most respectfully bet to recommend that it be at once put into practice, as I have no doubt but that Dr Muller would be most happy to furnish such an overseer who would of course act under his "Dr Muller's" directions. I most respectfully beg to recommend the foregoing to your favourable consideration</p>
