Ferdinand thinks it possible to spend his birthday with us, but I fear he will disappoint me again, he has so much to do.—What a dear little thing little Matthilde seems to be, when <seg style="">

               </seg> Barbar. — How does Bertha get on with her lessons? Mothers are seldom good Teachers, I hope I will be successful with Georgie, he has grown such a dear little fellow, he never crys, if it should happen once, Elisabeth comes running out of the kitchen to see what happened to him. He can say Papa &amp; Mama now, &amp; tries to say everything I tell him, though it is nothing like it; if he knocks his head he hits it, or holts the aching part to be kissed. They all love him so. William shoots birds for him &amp; he gets soup made of them. — I gathered a few muchrooms to ketsup, they are scarce here. I am going to re arrange our flower garden to my own taste. Good night now dearest.</p>
