We drive now every day an hour or two, in the hope that it will strengthen me. I am still getting thinner &amp; weaker, God only knows how it will end. — St. Helens is not sold yet. — We have a gentleman here to night, so must soon close this. We never ask company now, I am to nervous to entertain, instead of it cheering me up, I feel quite unable to do anything. — Georgie talks a great deal about the little Suters. The little Eliza had jammed her finger in the door, he cannot forget that at all. — We have already killed several snakes again, they have come out so early &amp; make us feel very uneasy. I expect Edward wishes for rain, the farmers &amp; settlers here are praying for it. My dear George sends his love to you all. —</p>
