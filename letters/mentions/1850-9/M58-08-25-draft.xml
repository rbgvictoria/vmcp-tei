               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>I will try &amp; write a few lines now, though Georgie runs out &amp; in &amp; claims my attention. I have much to tell you, first how very vexed we were to have missed Edward in Portland, we happened to be there the same day &amp; never heard of him being there till after he had left for Mt. Gam. 2 hours before. George was about the town all day &amp; also saw Mr. Traugmar, but he never told him that Edward was staying with Crouches. George brought me in to see Dr. Grier &amp; he would so much liked him to have a consultation with Ed about me. The roads were so bad, it was half past seven when we got there, &amp; I felt quite knocked up; the Dr. had to be called to me from the concert where Ed was to. I am sure Ed will be sorry to, not to have known we were in. In a way I feel more satisfied since seeing the Dr. &amp; the Medicin he gave me, has done me much good. We remained in Portland till Tuesday &amp; drove then to Mt Clay, &amp; yesterday home. We had left Georgie with Elisabeth &amp; you can imagine how pleased we were to see him again after 5? days absence. At present he is pushing his perambulator in the Garden &amp; comes every minute to call me, because he gets it stuck in the bushes. During our absence he got a little selvewilled, but I hope a few days will make him the dear old boy again. He really is a sweet child. He speaks every word quite plain now, just now he said "ah my". Yesterday we vaccinated him, he thought it good fun &amp; held out his other arm. - I had a very affec[tionate] letter from Georges eldest sister Mrs. Brown, she seems a clever woman, also one from <seg style="">
                  <hi rend="underline">Mrs. Davenport</hi>
               </seg> &amp; your dear letter the same day. (with "Toms" envelope which amysed me much.) am glad that both Mrs. Power &amp; Mrs. Lam are well, I will try &amp; write to both to day. Have you seen Partens? All the Ladys in Portland called on me &amp; I heard some good music &amp; singing. We went to church but could not hear a word of the sermon. Coming home we found a note from Mrs. Bicknell inviting us for a fortnight to there house; but I will decline for the present till I see the result of the Dr's Medicin. George is quite well, &amp; it will be soon decided now if we remain here or not. Have not heard from Ferdinand for a long time. Mrs. Montry is gone to Melbourne &amp; will bring me a summer mantle &amp; a few small things. — My husband joins me in love to you all &amp; Georgie sends kisses to all his cousins.</p>
