               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>Now for a gossip! — as George calls it. - I wish I could have little Bertha here while the building is going on, but the distance! I wish I could drive to Mr. Browns Station, but the shaking makes me feel ill. Our potatoes are growing splendidly &amp; we have still some rhubarb. Last Sunday we had the only apple in our garden, so large &amp; of a small tree; &amp; we have some grapes. - When I wrote last Mrs. Crabbe was still here, it was a pleasant week for us; one afternoon we all went fishing &amp; had a dish of fish for breakfast. They would have remained longer, but had to attend Miss Sharps' Wedding on the 19th. George left here on the 18th to drive with Mr. Grey. Next day the company was brought together with all disposable conveyances. George drove Mr. Henty's carriage. All were dressed well. The bride wore a white Morie antique Dress, white lace bonnet &amp; white crepe Mantel with rich trimmings. The bridesmaids wore blue silk dresses with blue crepe Mantles &amp; white bonnets. The breakfast was at Dodds. Mr. Grey had brought fruit &amp; ices from Melbourne. George &amp; others accompanied the pair for some miles &amp; in evening had a ball. George brought me a large piece of Cake &amp; some fruit. I had made for Miss Sharp a pretty pincusion of white sattin, covered with white Tarlatan leaving the sattin centre, the Tarlatan drawn through with Silverthread &amp; of the same a crocet border, it looked very elegant. She is a loveable &amp; talented girl, I trust she will be happy.</p>
