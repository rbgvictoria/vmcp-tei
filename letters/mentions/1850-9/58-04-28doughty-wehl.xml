[...] I am surprised that the Tilley's did not go with their brother. George Glen must be sorry to have lost his Baby. We were so glad to hear that Mr. Dunlopp is going to marrie the little Brewer, they have liked each other so long. [...] Yesterday was our Georgies birthday, the dear little chap, he is so happy. I have put him in short coats, he looks so pretty in them &amp; is so comic, &amp; imitates what he sees us do, he can say tatta when he gets anything, bread is br — the fowls are tucki-tucki-tucki-darah! [...] We had Mr. Charles Grey here last night, he is so happy, a week ago Mrs. Grey had a little daughter. - George will buy a gig now, we will not lend it again, I had to stay home all the summer because Medleys broke our old wagon, &amp; it is so needful for me to get out sometimes. Last Sunday George drove us to the beach, Mr. Medley rode; o how Georgie was surprised at the great water. I took a long walk with Elisabeth &amp; William on horseback with Georgie &amp; some bags in front of him, to pick bullrushes to stuff some pillows with, I thought the walk would do me good, but instead of that I feel quite ill &amp; my head is very bad. It hurts my head to write therefor Mrs. Power must a bit, give her &amp; Mrs. Glen my love.</p>
