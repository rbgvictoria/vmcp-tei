               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>Last postday George wrote, because I felt to ill &amp; in to great anxiety about my dear Baby. God be thanked that he is now getting better though far from well yet. You see I am again at Browns Station with Mrs. Montray for change of air for myself &amp; baby. I cannot tell you what anxiety I had on his account. etc. Mrs. Crabb lost her baby; they were a fortnight with us &amp; a great relief when her husband came for them. [...] We shall remain here a fortnight, Elisabeth also, she too is very poorly. Poor George will be lonely at home without us. You cannot think how kind the Montreys are. Last week when Mr. Montrey found me in tears, he went home &amp; brought Mrs. M. the same evening to stay with me two days &amp; made me promise to come to them as soon as the Crabbs left us, which we did with much pleasure. They have given me a nice large bedroom, &amp; joining it a nice room with a fireplace for Elisabeth &amp; Georgie. How good God is, always sending us dear freinds when we are so in need of them. Since I wrote last we had a large bushfire, George worked himself half to death &amp; when he had mastered it, it broke out in another place; then God sent rain &amp; put it out, not much damage done. Had a kind letter from Mrs. Power. I was so pleased when I saw "Momos" v. "Chester" I could have embraced the horses. One day when Crabbs were with us we had Judge Wrixon &amp; Mr. Atkinson from Melbourne. Mrs. Crabb had lost her baby 4 days before she came, the poor woman could not bear her house any longer &amp; came before I had any preparation made. She was so indulgent to the children that they were a great truble, they nearly spoilt my carpet &amp; I had to take it up to prevent it being ruined altogether, I would not like to live that time over again. Our Ferdinand has had more honors confered on him, it must be very gratifiing to him. God bless &amp; keep us all.</p>
