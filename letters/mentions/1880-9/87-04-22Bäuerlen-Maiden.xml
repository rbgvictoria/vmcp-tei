               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>Leaves, Bark &amp; Gum, I sent from Monga under the name of Eucalyptus — (Peppermint) as also Leaves, Bark &amp; Gum I sent in February from Bombala under the same name (Eucalyptus — (Peppermint)) Baron von Müller has since decided to be Eucalyptus amygdalina (var) though the trees are considerably different[.] From Nelligen I sent you in Sept. or Oct. a supply of Leaves, Bark &amp; Gum from a tree with deciduous bark and quite different appearance, locally named "Ribbon Gum", this also the Baron decided at the time to be Eucalyptus amygdalina. Still another tree, with a rough persistent bark, locally named "Mountain Ash" of which I have sent you no material yet, he has also determined to be Eucalyptus amygdalina. This I think is for practical purposes very unsatisfactory, as the timber, bark and gum (leaving the leaves out of question) of those trees is widely different. The same applies to varieties(?) of some other species more or less. What I would like to know now is this: whether you or your department would undertake to carry on experiments with the materials of each variety, while in my wanderings through different districts of the colony, I would have a special look out to get a complete set of specimens of each species and variety for you, that means: specimens of leaves in the young state, spec. of fl[owers] and of fruit. To such spec. I intend to att[ach] beside the name of locality and date, also approximately the elevation and geological formation. Each species or variety I intend to have determined by Baron von Müller, whose names could be retained until material enough has accumulated from different parts of the colony (therefore from different [ele]vations and different formations) to institute prope[r] comparisons, not only of the specimens themselves but also the results of your experiments or investigations. This is in my humble opinion the only re[li]able way to deal with the perplexing genus of Euca[lypt]us. Such a mode of proceeding will take some [...] time, but would very likely lead to most unexp[ect]ed results.</p>
