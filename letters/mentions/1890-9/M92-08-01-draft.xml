               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>With regard to preparing a supplementary Volume to the Flora Australiensis. This has been promised by Baron Mueller but he is never likely to prepare such a volume as that required as the whole tendency of his writings is to destroy Bentham's most excellent work, therefore he could not be trusted to prepare the additional volume required which should be on the same plan as the seven volumed work</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>I should be willing to prepare the manuscript for the volume but the difficulty would be as to the printing. Who will be found to print &amp; publish? It would make a volume of about 400 pages and I might promise to be ready for the printer in about a year from commencing, and the expense of publishing would have to be met by sale of book. The 7 vols of the Flora were published under the authority of the several Governments of the Australian Colonies between the years 1863 &amp; 1875. I am afraid it would be found impossible to make a similar arrangement for the supplementary volume, particularly as Baron Mueller is so strongly opposed to the classification &amp; nomenclature. Although mind you that adopted by Mr Bentham is the same as use in all the great herbaria of the world — I may remark that if I did the work I should have to do it out of office hours —</p>
