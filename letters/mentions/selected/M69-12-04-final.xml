Is the "back-door" at the Land Office still accessible to distinguished visitors? I thought that it had been "bricked up" some time since. The Press and the public must be awake, for others are not sleeping, and the same sinister influences which have so long bolstered up a system which is "rotten to the core," are now being employed more vigorously than ever to prevent the long-wished-for reformation in the Melbourne Botanical Gardens.
