It is, indeed, a wonder that the truculent letters of Mr. W. L. Morton, in behalf of his patron, have not ere this called forth indignant replies from some of the intelligent gardeners of Victoria, for the tone of them was most defiant to the gardening world.<note xml:id="ftn2" type="footnote" n="2">

Morton's letter being criticized appeared in the <seg style="font-style: italic; ">Argus</seg>, 5 November 1869, p. 7; 'An Old Gardener' has slightly misquoted the text. Morton wrote a further letter to the <seg style="font-style: italic; ">Argus</seg> that appeared in the issue of 10 November 1869, p. 7 and on 11 November 1869, p. 5 wrote pointing out that M had written to him, to express regret that the letter of 10 November had been written (see L. Morton to M. 10 November 1869).</p>
               </note> I am afraid to trespass upon your space as I should much like to do, in order to analyse those celebrated epistles; but I would ask any person at all cognisant of things, as they have been carried on for many years at the Botanical Gardens, what end has all the lavish and wasteful expenditure of money and other resources for the last eleven years served, save the personal glorification of Dr. Mueller, who has come to look upon the establishment that has been such a mine of fame to him as existing for and in future to be maintained, as an appanage of his own, which it is nothing short of sacrilege to criticise?</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>The Minister of Lands deserves the highest credit for attempting to cleanse the Augean stable, and I trust that he will receive every moral support from the intelligent gardeners of Victoria, who have long felt hurt at seeing their national garden a disgrace to the city, and a bye-word and proverb among visitors from the other colonies who have had the opportunity of comparing the gardens of Sydney, Adelaide, and Hobart Town with that of Melbourne; which latter establishment might be fitly described as a place where every known and approved principle of cultivation is persistently and systematically ignored. But how is it, Mr. Editor, that Mr. Ferguson is not yet installed in his proper position; for visitors to the garden who have inquired for him have been there assured that he is not coming at all, and that the existing order, or rather disorder, of things cannot be touched even by Mr. M'Kean. This seems very strange, and has been a great disappointment to many who hoped now for better things. Is the "back-door" at the Land Office still accessible to distinguished visitors? I thought that it had been "bricked up" some time since. The Press and the public must be awake, for others are not sleeping, and the same sinister influences which have so long bolstered up a system which is "rotten to the core," are now being employed more vigorously than ever to prevent the long-wished-for reformation in the Melbourne Botanical Gardens. I may return to the subject, if you will allow me a portion of your space,<note xml:id="ftn3" type="footnote" n="3">
