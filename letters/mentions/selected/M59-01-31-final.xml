               </seg> years of Age, at that very early period I knew more than 300 Wild Plants When in London I was for 20 years a Fellow of the Linnaean Society, one of the highest natural societies in the world, I was for a long period one of the Council of the London Botanical Society, The Mathematical Society, the Microscopical Society, and am still of the Linnaean and Horticultural Societies. For 12 years I was professor of Botany at a London Hospital, am the author of 17 books, several of them Botanical, &amp; am now in correspondence with many of the older &amp; better botanists, as Sir W. Hooker Dr Lindley &amp;c. Thus I am not assumed by the other hemisphere to be ignorant, however I may be here. The difference between Dr Mueller &amp; myself is that he receives £600 a year &amp; has only scientific &amp; mental employment. I with half the sum have uninterrupted manual labor merely like a foreman, with evening and Sunday occupation also, have no time then to make myself known as a Botanist or to explore the country. In the forth coming English work therefore I fear that our colony will come badly off in comparison with others — Mr Drummond had 600# a year for exploring Swan River, Mr Cunningham the same for the Moreton Bay district, and both of them were allowed to sell their surplus collections after a certain number of specimens had been supplied to the Home Government. This will soon be the only colony of Australia, without its published Flora. Dr J. Hooker has just completed very elaborate ones of Tasmania &amp; New Zealand.<note xml:id="ftn5" type="footnote" n="5">
