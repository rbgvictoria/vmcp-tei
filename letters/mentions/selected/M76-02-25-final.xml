As you will observe these are for the most part unnamed species from the islands of the Western Pacific, some of which may prove to be new and acceptable to you.

               </note> These are different from any hitherto [collected], with perhaps one or two exceptions, and will prove valuable additions to our timber collection at Kew after the Exhibition is over. I sent the specimens to Mr Bentham direct, as Muellers unaccountable conduct to me of late, renders it quite impossible for me to send specimens through him for the future. When referring to any of my plants in his Fragmenta, he mentions one of my assistants, Carrons name instead of my own. <note xml:id="ftn4" type="footnote" n="4">

                     <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>Moore's displeasure with M's conduct is also reported in C. Moore to G. Bentham, 19 February 1876, Royal Botanic Gardens Kew, Archives, Bentham Correspondence, vol. 7, f. 2862. The relevant portion of that letter was printed in <seg style="font-style: italic; ">Australian Systematic Botany Society newsletter</seg>, no. 59, June 1989, p. 18, but the date of the letter given there is a misreading. In the letter to Bentham, Moore asserts that M 'adopted the unjustifiable course of giving in recent numbers of his Fragmenta, the credit to Carron one of my employees of having discovered the plants collected by myself, and in localities where he never was e.g. the Bellinger River'. In B75.12.01, p. 171, M erected <seg style="font-style: italic; ">Carronia </seg>(<seg style="font-style: italic; ">C</seg>. <seg style="font-style: italic; ">multiepalea</seg>), listing the specimens used as 'Ad fluvium Bellingeri, Carron; ad originem fluminis Clarence-River, Wilcox'. Specimens MEL 42197, MEL 42199, MEL 42200 are listed as syntypes, said to have been collected by W. Carron, but no dates are given and the labels are in Moore’s hand; MEL 42197 also has M’s herbarium label on which M identifies Carron as collector. There is a syntype of <seg style="font-style: italic; ">Cupaniopsis foveolata</seg> (MEL 108616) where the label is again in Moore’s handwriting but where M credits it to Carron as collector among the specimens used when describing the species: 'Ad Nulla-Nulla prope origenem fluminis McLeay's River, nec non ad flumen Bellenger's River, Carron' (B75.07.01, p. 95). Carron's obituary supports Moore's clams that Carron was not with him on the Bellinger River (<seg style="font-style: italic; ">Sydney mail and NSW advertiser</seg>, 11 March 1876, p. 348).</p>

I doubt much whether this arrangement will work well or for any great length of time' (C. Moore to J. Hooker, 8 September 1870, f. 230, p. 4). He reported in detail on a visit to Melbourne a few months before M's position as Director of the Gardens was abolished, when he found 'poor Mueller' to be 'as miserable a man as there is in the whole Continent of Australia'; see C. Moore to J. Hooker, 24 February 1873 (in this edition as M73-02-24).</p>

Moore to W. Thiselton-Dyer, 15 August 1878, f. 258).</p>
