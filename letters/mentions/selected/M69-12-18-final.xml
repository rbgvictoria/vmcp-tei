               <seg style="">,—The public scientific career of Dr. Mueller dates from the time of Governor Latrobe. Dr. Mueller, being at that period a "peripatetic philosopher," was engaged by Mr. Latrobe as "Government botanist," to arrange and compile a "Flora of Victoria" within the definite space of three years. Mr. Latrobe finished his course soon after was succeeded by Sir Charles Hotham, who at once dispensed with Dr. Mueller's services, as being unnecessary and superfluous. Upon the death of Sir Charles Hotham and the advent of Sir Henry Barkly, Dr. Mueller and his friends managed, in those wild times of official extravagance, to secure his (Dr. Mueller's) reappointment as Government botanist, and very soon after as director of the Botanical Gardens. Thus placed in possession of a high position and almost unlimited means, Dr. Mueller has for many years used them so well for his own benefit, that he has hitherto been able and still endeavours to defy public opinion and the Ministerial head of his department. The first Government of Mr. Heales endeavoured to curtail the extravagance of the Botanical Gardens, and introduce the needful practical skill; but they were defeated, mainly through the adroit parliamentary tactics of Dr. Greeves. Since then, no other Government has had the courage to attempt the cleansing of the Augean stable, until the present Minister of Lands grappled with the hydra, and it is much to be hoped that all "good men and true" will support him to a successful result.</seg>

                  <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>Dr. Mueller has established a Botanical Museum, but it is wholly useless to anybody but himself; it is inaccessible to the public, except under circumstances which most effectually preclude any educated persons from attempting to avail themselves of the vast stores of material for "phytological research" which, we are informed in themystifying "reports" of the Government botanist, it contains. It is simply a large cupboard for keeping Dr. Mueller's dried specimens in. Dr. Mueller has published two works, one the "Flora of Victoria," a most expensive work, and a smaller one written in Latin, and rejoicing in the astounding title of "Fragmenta Phytographiæ Australiæ." Now, Sir, I do not pretend to criticise those works, they are doubtless very good; but what use are they to the colony? The British Government, long since, commissioned the celebrated botanist, Mr. Bentham, to compile a comprehensive work on the Australian flora, and from the ample stores of information available to that gentleman, there is no doubt but that the work will be worthy of its author. Dr. Mueller has managed to get himself somewhat associated with Mr. Bentham, and a good many of the "treasures" of the Botanical Gardens Museum have been sent to London, with the ostensible view of assisting in the preparation of the work; but I question very much if Mr. Bentham has derived much real assistance from them. A synopsis of Mr. Bentham's work is all that for many years would be necessary to the student in Victoria; while, regarding the Latin work with the long name, no sensible man would for one moment hesitate to say that it is perfectly useless to the Victorian public—in fact, it was never meant for them, but solely for exportation, and to spread the name and fame of its author in continental scientific circles. The science of the Botanical Gardens has assumed no popular form whatever. There never have been any lectures delivered from it; no handbooks intelligible to ordinary minds have emanated from Dr. Mueller's pen. The popular British flora of Sir W. J. Hooker, "The School Botany" and "Theory of Horticulture" of John Lindley have no counterpart here; and so far as the light of botanic science as applied to the life and labours of 999 in the 1,000 of the population of Victoria is concerned, it is and ever has been at the Melbourne Botanical Gardens "hid under a bushel."</seg>

                  <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>A chemical department and chemist have been of late years added to the means at the disposal of Dr. Mueller; but the results are yet to come. Much noise was made about the great discoveries that would be effected in the way of gums and resins from native plants and timber, the extraction of essential oils, and the discovery of tissue and fibres available for paper and cordage manufacturing; but Mr. Bosisto, of Richmond, and Mr. Cosmo Newbery claim priority in these matters, and have, I believe, nearly exhausted the subject; at any rate, the results of the Laboratory at the Botanical Gardens are very mythical up to the present time. It is, Sir, no use mincing the matter further; the whole of Dr. Mueller's science is and has been solely applied for the purpose of building up his European fame. I do not say that this is an improper motive by any means, but the Victorian taxpayers, who have to pay for it all, may be excused for feeling indignant that the vast resources of money and other means ostensibly provided for the purpose of making and maintaining a beautiful and practically useful public garden, should have been for so many years frittered away upon visionary crotchets or schemes having only one object in view, that of extending and maintaining, in most instances by the most mendacious puffery, the name and fame of Dr. Von Mueller, &amp;c.</seg>
