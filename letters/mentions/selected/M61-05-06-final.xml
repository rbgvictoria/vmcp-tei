During the three years which have since elapsed, I have not, it is true, commenced the drawing up of the Work, which I could not do until the necessary outlay should have been officially sanctioned, but, as the project appeared to meet with the strong approval both of the Colonial Government at home and of the Governments of the several Australian Colonies, as well as of Dr. Mueller, the very able Government Botanist at Melbourne, I have kept it steadily in view in the different botanical investigations I have been engaged in, and have incidentally worked up several Australian Genera. I have made many preliminary arrangements, and, in conjunction with yourself and Dr. Hooker, I have matured the plan in all its details, and exemplified it in the Flora of the Island of Hongkong, lately published.<note xml:id="ftn7" type="footnote" n="7">

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>I have now passed my sixtieth year, and if the commencement of the Australian Flora is further delayed, I cannot hope, even should I live, to retain sufficient vigour of mind and body to complete it in a satisfactory manner. At the same time, I cannot but be aware that, having devoted nearly forty years of my life to the study of the Botany of all parts of the world, I have had great practical experience both in the preparation and use of Local Floras; that I am now established in the only centre where the vast collections made by travellers and explorers in Australia can be compared with each other, as well as with the products of other regions; that I am moreover in friendly communication with those French and German establishments which must be consulted in the course of the work; and that I have thus acquired peculiar facilities for the preparation of a general Flora of Australia, so limited as to form and bulk, that I might hope to bring it to a conclusion. This would also be to me a labour of love, provided I could be in some measure indemnified for the cost I should incur, and for the time I should have to take from other pursuits. </p>

They are too bulky and costly for practical use by those who would study the comparative vegetation of the several colonies with a view to the development of their productive capabilities, or for those who, either resident or travelling in the country, may have a few leisure moments to continue the investigation of its Flora, and who require a portable and readily consultable summary of all that is known on the subject, as a starting-point for further research. The productions of adjoining Colonies are moreover so intimately connected with each other, that to answer the above purposes effectually, a general work is required, that should embrace the whole Flora of the Australian Continent and adjoining islands, but in which the typographical arrangements should be such as to show at a glance which species are peculiar to one, or common to two or more of the separate Colonies. </p>
