The only other memorial that I know of is a bas-relief head &amp; bust made by a German moulder named Saupe (now dead) in the form of a large medallion, which for many years was, &amp; probably still is in the Royal Society's Hall. The one place where there should be a memorial is the National Herbarium, which is really the monument of the Baron's work. There are but few of us left now who go back as workers to the older days — thirty or more years ago, when he was a very well-known figure. French of course knows more about his inner life &amp; methods of working than anyone else, as he was his trusty assistant for long years right through the early days of the Garden period &amp; for long after.</p>
