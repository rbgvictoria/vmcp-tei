               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>Some <space unit="chars" quantity="1"/>short time ago on consideration of my Explorations in your Colony, The Rt Honorable the Secretary of State for the Colonies authorised the then Governor of Western Australia Sir William Robinson, C.M.G. to make me a moderate Grant of Land in Western Australia and which the Governor with the advice of the Executive Council fixed at 2000 acres.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>The first intimation I got of its being done was from my friend and Brother Explorer, Mr. John Forrest who informed me in letter of the fact, at the same time telling me if I would sell my Grant he could get me 8/- per acre or £800. By the succeeding mail I received a friendly note from His Excellency Sir William Robinson confirming the fact of my Grant, both these letters I showed to my friend Baron von Mueller and he became anxious to purchase my Grant at the price mentioned by Mr Forrest as it would be cheaper than he could purchase from the Crown — and he asked me to give him the first offer of the Grant eventually I did so and sold my Grant to Baron Mueller and received the sum of £800 sterling, I agreeing to sign any documents necessary to put him in possession of the purchase.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>It appears that as soon as Baron Mueller became the owner he addressed Mr. Forrest upon the subject of the selection of the land. Mr. Forrest recommending a certain spot which Baron Mueller would have been agreeable to had he not just then, for the benefit of his health <seg style="">
                  <hi rend="underline">and to personally select</hi>
               </seg> the Land determined to visit Western Australia — he therefore Telegraphed to Mr. Forrest to delay selection until he arrived — but when he did arrive he found the Land had been selected but not surveyed. Not liking the selection he desired to take it up elsewhere — This it appears has been denied him and he is forced to accept a piece of Land under my Grant which I certainly should not have selected and which he could not sell if he wanted to for more than £200 if that which would compel upon him the loss of £600, the value of the Grant being in the <seg style="">
                  <hi rend="underline">right</hi>
               </seg> of selection not in the selection itself.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>Having shown the circumstances of the case I trust your Excellency will think with me that a forced acceptance of this particular selection upon Baron Mueller through the misconception of a friend at a distance would scarcely be showing the courtesy and generosity intended by the Colonists of Western Australia and of the Rt. Hon. the Secretary of State for the Colonies to me, if my purchaser is compelled to lose so large a sum of money as £600 by the transaction, or to Baron Mueller (as purchaser) to whom Western Australia is deeply indebted for many years for actual and persistent furtherance of West Australian Exploration and his studied development of the interesting Flora &amp; Forest interests of the Colony.</p>

Malcolm Fraser the Surveyor General of Western Australia in Melbourne the other day on this matter and he informed me if the subject were referred to him by your Excellency he should be compelled to put his vote against any alteration in Baron Muellers selection being made as it would form a dangerous precedent I was not then aware that Baron Mueller had telegraphed (before he went himself to W.A.) to Mr. Forrest to delay the selection and I therefore had no answer to give Mr. Fraser but now knowing all the circumstances of the case, I trust your Excellency will allow the Baron a fresh selection as such a precedent can have no danger as a case like the present not being very likely ever to occur again — and even the stereotyped horror of a dangerous precedent where justice and right are involved will I trust be overlooked<note xml:id="ftn3" type="footnote" n="3">
