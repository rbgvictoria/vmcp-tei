Bowen, 19 August 1878 (Unit 32A, VPRS 1987 despatches of the Secretary of State to the Governor, vol. 32, pt 2, July-December 1878, <seg style="font-weight: bold; ">VA number</seg>, Public Record Office, Victoria). A working draft of this letter, addressed to the Under Secretary at the Colonial Office, R. Herbert, is in RBG Kew, Colonial floras, Kewensia, K9/655.59, ff.86-9. It differs in a number of respects from this distributed version, including deletion of a paragraph drawing attention to the importance of 'this establishment [i.e. the Royal Gardens, Kew] to our Colonial Empire'.

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>In a scientific point of view the "Flora Australiensis" is of inestimable value. It records the nature of the great bulk of the "Flora" with all the knowledge and skill of one of the greatest living sytematists, and this, while the natural conditions of the country can still be easily distinguished from the inevitable changes which must follow agricultural occupation and the operaton of a wide-spread commerce.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>The accumulation in London, and principally at Kew, of the important botanical collections made by successive travellers and explorers, from the date of Captain Cook's voyages to the present day, have made the preparation in this country of the "Flora Australiensis" a matter of necessity. The labours of these men are bound up with the history of the Australian Colonies, and the mere barren enumeration of Australian plants, apart from the names of their first discoverers, would be an ungrateful obliteration of much that Australians will always hold in respect. Nor must it be forgotten, that many species obtained through the industry of these early collectors have never been gathered twice.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>To no one was the force of these facts more apparent than to Baron von Mueller, the distinguished Government Botanist of Victoria; not merely did he therefore waive his own, in many respects preeminent claims to the authorship of the "Flora Australiesis" but, with singular generosity, he transmitted to this country his immense Australian Herbarium, the examination of which was indispensible to the proper elaboraton of the work. He, furthermore, allowed duplicate specimens to be taken from his collections for preservation at Kew as the authentic types upon which the descriptions published in the "Flora" had been based.</p>
