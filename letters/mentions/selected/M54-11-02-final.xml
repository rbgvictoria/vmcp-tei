               </note> to investigate the plants of the Territory. That Botanist has brought himself to our special notice by his talents &amp; assiduity &amp; by the scientific importance of his researches. And he has had the industry to draw up excellent Latin descriptions (with observations) of all his numerous discoveries: he has further prepared a List or catalogue of all the previously described plants. In short, he has the materials before him of an excellent &amp; useful "Flora of the Colony of Victoria." A copy of this, he has done me the favor to send me; &amp; all those to whom I have shown it cordially agree with me that it deserves publication &amp; would, if published reflect very great credit, both on the Author, Dr Mueller, &amp; on the Colony which has placed him in a position to prepare it. Indeed, unless such a use is made of the Mst, Dr Mueller's services are almost, if not wholly, lost to the public.</p>

It is not like a popular book, of which the sale might cover the cost: but I should hope the colony would see fit to remove that difficulty by a suitable grant. The subject has had much of my attention, &amp; I am pretty familiar with the nature &amp; expence of such publications; &amp; I am prepared to say that a grant of £300 would supply the needful outlay in enabling a Publisher to undertake the work. A large portion of this sum would be required for Editorial expences, the labor of adding the descriptions of the known species, &amp; a careful comparison of Dr. Mueller's specimens &amp; descriptions with the authentic specimens of the several authors in the Herbaria of Europe, without which the work would still be imperfect</p>
