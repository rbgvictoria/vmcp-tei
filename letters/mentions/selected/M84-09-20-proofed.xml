               </note> Nor do I remember who was Premier in 1877 certainly either yourself of Mr Berry. I cannot suppose that you believe that the expenditure namely £170 would be attacked by the Assembly but if you wish it, I will undertake to get a joint deputation from the Royal Society and the Field Naturalists’ Club to you or to Mr Berry strongly urging upon the Government to undertake a work which will bring within ordinary comprehension the voluminous works of the Baron which are now sealed books save to the few who read Latin with sufficient fluency to understand the 12 Volumes of the "Fragmenta" It is purely in the interests of scientific investigation and study that I am so much interested. There are many more in the Colony who could do the work as all the materials are already published at the cost of the Colony — even I myself could do it, but it would take me months to do what the Baron could do in a day or two. I dont think you have ever found me out in advocating anything from a Government to serve my own purposes and no human being can suggest — much less prove — that I have any object in view but the honest desire and confirmed belief that a Botanical Key will not only be popular but do more than either you or I can f[o]retell for the advancement of scientific enquiry. If it required a fresh vote from the Assembly and a discussion in the House I would admit that your hands are full — but it does not — the money is already voted and the Baron says he can undertake it.<note xml:id="ftn4" type="footnote" n="4">

               </note> Why then in the name of your and my common interest in the intellectual progress of the Colony should the expenditure of £170 be contested. I was warm this morning and I regret it because you are generally supposed to be moved by argument rather than by sentiment. I shall not trouble you again however because I feel that I am justified in warmly advocating this publication but I must leave it to your own good sense. You possibly have not made a study of Botany as I have &amp; perhaps you may be unaware of the momentous issues as to Darwin's theory which depend upon further investigation into the Vegetable Kingdom. As a leader of a democracy surely you will encourage the progress of scientific thought. I am sick of writing — as you no doubt are of reading on this subject. As I said to Col. Sargood today you as leader of Federation should make it an Australian work — the first ever printed.<note xml:id="ftn5" type="footnote" n="5">
