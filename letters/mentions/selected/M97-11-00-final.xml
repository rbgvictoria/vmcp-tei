Apart from his purely scientific work, upon the value of which it is unnecessary to dwell, the Baron von Mueller devoted himself to the development of the more practical side of various branches of work, such as those connected with Forestry, Agriculture, Horticulture, Pharmacy and, not least, Geographical Exploration.
