Lightfoot, who had been entrusted with the task of presenting it to the Chief Secretary. Lightfoot concluded his letter: 'I would beg to add, that I have used the road now shut up, for twelve years, and that the one substituted will be impassible in the wet weather'.</p>

On 14 July, McCulloch minuted: 'Acknowledge receipt and state that enquiries will be made on the subject | Request Dr Mueller to wait on me'. The next day, the Under Secretary, J. Moore, referred the document to M 'for report'. For M's response, see M to J. McCulloch, 18 July 1863.</p>
