To day is the dear Childs birthday, 25 years old, how the time has gone, fancy my baby that age! I am glad she is very happy in her vocation, every one tells me how bright &amp; happy she looks. I would like to see her in her Nurses Uniform. - Thank you for sending Ett my letter, it was thoughtful of you; yes I get a good deal of writing, but sometimes keep you all waiting longer then I like. I had letters from Ferd &amp; Art on 12th. Ferd was doing very well, but it is a hard rough life for him &amp; the heat so great; he wrote by a rushlight in a draughty hut, because his spare candles had melted; still he likes his present employment better then the life on that Station; &amp; he is likely to make a little money when once his teams are paid for.
