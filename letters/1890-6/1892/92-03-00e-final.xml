At that time the most eastern part of Gippsland was unsettled, and the last eastern habitation was deserted, as of the two inhabitants, the "hut-keeper" had just before been slain by the cannibals of that region, and the "stock-man" had only saved his life on horseback by jumping the fences of the station. The last part of my journey then had to be effected on foot, as I could not get my horses without help across the Snowy River; yet accompanied by one "old hand," I penetrated, armed, of course, for several miles beyond the locality of the massacre, through the dense "bush," the autochthones getting often near us, and being in possession of fire-arms robbed from the hut. I satisfied myself there and then that the Gippsland Palm was the genuine <name key="Livistona%20australis">Livistona australis</name> of my never-to-be-forgotten friend, Von Martius, this species being well known here in cultivation. Already, then, since that time the same noble Palm has been discovered in two other localities, in jungles not very far from the Snowy River, which watercourse, though bearing so frigid a name as coming from the Australian Alps, where I had just before advanced to the glaciers of its courses, flows in its lowest course really through an always winterless country, teeming with sub-tropical vegetation (</seg>

It would seem furthermore that the petioles of young plants are far more spinous than those of aged plants, a remark fitting also L. australis. The correctness of this observation might be tested even in European conservatories. When in 1856 I saw a tall Livistona far in the interior of Arnhem's-land, evidently the same which Leichhardt noticed there in 1845,</seg>

The petioles are somewhat spiney at the lower part, and attain a length of 5 feet, and that is also the maximum length of the leaves; these in a young state are of a splendid coppery colour, and in age of a remarkable pale green. The panicle had been seen to attain a length of 10 feet, according to notes from the German missionaries in Central Australia.</seg>

               <seg style=""> As seemingly germinable seeds were sent by me long ago to European gardens, it is probably now a well-known Palm in culture there, as it is in some parts of Australia. Should this not be the case with you, then living plants might be obtained, for instance, from Mr. J. Edgar, of Rockhampton, Queensland. The fruitlets are globular, and particularly large, from the Western Australia locality in contrast with those of L. australis from which species L. Mariae is also distinguished by the paler leaves, with elongated rachis, which forms a solid axis sometimes nearly 1 foot long beyond the petiole, whereby the leaf gets a somewhat cuneate form; on this account it seems likely that the unnamed Livistona, referred to in the </seg>

The flowers, as seen on the West Australian plant, are hardly of half the size, compared to those of L. australis. </seg>
