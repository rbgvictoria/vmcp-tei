It was carefully taken up, all its umbrageous fronds were cut away, and being then securely boxed up in a large case of Eucalyptus wood, and shipped on a mail steamer of the Peninsular and Oriental Line, it reached Dublin in safety a day or two before the celebration began, and … was a source of much interest to the numerous visitors on that occasion. Baron Von Mueller writes as follows : —<space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>

During my forty-five years of uninterrupted researches in Australia, I have only met with about ten gigantic specimens of <name key="Todea">Todea</name>, and I do not know of any place where one would be likely to find good specimens weighing over a ton, and even small specimens are uncommon anywhere. What may make this particular <name key="Todea">Todea</name> of special interest as 'a memorial plant' is the likelihood of its having begun its career from a spore about the time when the University of Dublin was founded, viz., in 1591.<note xml:id="ftn2" type="footnote" n="2">

Such a novel and valuable gift is deserving of especial welcome and every good treatment, and it is proposed to build a special cool Fern-house for its reception, where it is to be hoped it may long remain in health and beauty as a memorial of the great tercentenary celebration of the University, and of Baron Von Mueller's good will and generosity in sending such a welcome addition to the treasures of the University Botanical Garden.</p>
