               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>At the Council meeting on Friday, I may as well inform you (in addition to what I wrote to Mr Macdonald) that Mr Crummer spoke bitterly against what he called Victorian interference, as if they in Sydney were not able to manage their own affairs. You may depend upon it that I did not let that misstatement go unrefuted. I showed the necessity laid upon the Antarctic Committee to state publicly, before long, what it intended to do with the moneys already collected seeing that the Swedish-Australasian Expedition had been abandoned, and also that the committee had all along carried on direct communication with the Governments of Australasia. As in Victoria, every one had to get away to catch his train, so the meeting was hurried through.

I pressed him very earnestly to make an effort to get a good meeting on Tuesday, and share in the glory of getting an Antarctic expedition out into the field. He said he would do all that he could, but he must have a month in which to collect before he touched Mr Reid's money. I pointed out that future co-operation would be endangered if the present available vote were lost through his views of a Victorian taint on money prevailing with the Society. Victorian geographers took broader grounds, and while they would not let the matter of Antarctic Exploration drop, because of a rebuf, the Committee would no doubt by and by make an independent effort.</p>

Secretary of the Antarctic Committee, it is hereby resolved — (a) That all the funds raised in New South Wales for the Antarctic expedition be placed in the hands of Trustees in trust for Antarctic Exploration.

I presume that I shall leave here (Sydney) on Wednesday morning). It is too expensive to stay long. Sir George desires to be kindly remembered to you.
