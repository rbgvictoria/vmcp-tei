               </note> I have the honor of expressing my best thanks for these arrangements made by the Government, and beg to assure especially the hon. Mr M'Lean, that nothing shall be left undone within my power, to merit the continued confidence placed in my administration In reference to the retaining of a portion of my staff, I beg to recommend, that Mr J. G. Luehmann at his salary of £325 be kept on, he having been in the Govern. Botanist's establishment now for 22 years 11 months uninterruptedly, so that by retaining him in this branch of the service his long experience can be further utilized, and also the claims of seniority will be respected. Further I would recommend, that Mr J. R. Tovey, who receives £66 annually now, be also left in the service of my institution, the fund available admitting of this, and he being able to exercise a continuous guardianship over the Herbarium, his sleeping place having already been since his engagement in the herbarium-Building.<note xml:id="ftn3" type="footnote" n="3">

                     xml:lang="en">On 15 January 1892, Wilson had instructed M that he should inform members of his staff that his department was to be abolished on 31 March, and it was presumably in response to this that, a few days later, M forwarded letters from Luehmann and Tovey applying to be transferred to another department (respectively U92/708 and U92/797, VPRS 1168, VA 475 Chief Secretary's Department, Public Record Office, Victoria). The subsequent decision not to abolish the department after all led to the present letter. Tovey had been appointed as Third Herbarium Assistant on 1 December 1890. </p>

I wish to impress on Baron Von Mueller the fact which I have already verbally mentioned, namely, that the £1200 to which it has been determined to reduce the expenses of the Government Botanist's establishment is not in any case to be exceeded; and, while I, of course, desire, as far as may be, to leave to him to judge how the available funds can be best expended in the public interests, I wish, for the reasons stated, to give him the opportunity of further considering the matter.</p>
