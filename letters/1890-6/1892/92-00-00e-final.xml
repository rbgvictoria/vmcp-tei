I am of opinion that there is only one species of Livistona on the Eastern coast and that there are several varieties produced by climatic influence. For instance there is a plant here which was kept in a pot five or six years. And out of curiosity about nine years ago I had it planted in the dryest part of our grounds. The soil was not prepared in any way except digging a small hole in which to plant it and keeping it watered until it was established. that plant has grown very little larger since and from the ground to the tip of the longest leaf would not measure 2 ft yet the parent plant had a clear stem of at at least 60 ft. but it was growing in a moist mountain gorge any one meeting in the bush for the first time a dwarf plant such as I described and some time finding a clump of tall trees from 40 to 80 ft high would naturally take them for different species. I would not like to give an idea of the number of year required for providing my poor little plant with a 10 ft stem.</p>
