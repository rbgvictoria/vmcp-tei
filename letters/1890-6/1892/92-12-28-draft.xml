He also desires me to intimate that he felt somewhat surprised at the action of the Hon. Secretary the Rev. Mr Potter in approaching the head of the Government of this Colony for the object of getting the grant placed as desired by him, having been informed at the time that he was acting contrary to the wishes of the Council, and without the sanction of the President, who, if he had been communicated with on the subject previous to Mr Potter's visit, would have sent a definite refusal to ask for such an unreasonable concession to be made and much trouble and misunderstanding would thus have been avoided.</p>

The President and the Council feel that it would not be in strict conformity with the conditions expected should be fulfilled by collecting that amount entirely within the Colony, and not out of sums already promised or donated, and might lead to questions being raised by the Treasury.</p>
