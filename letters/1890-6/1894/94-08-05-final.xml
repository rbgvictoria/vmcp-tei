Had we made too much of the Gold-Indications then, numbers of "Prospectors", enticed by any uncautiousness of ours, would have fallen under the hands of the Cannibals! —</p>

I think I cannot do wrong in writing at once to Sir John Forrest or Lady Forrest, who are personally known to me, informing them of Lady Hookers Offer. It would be better, to do that than to write direct to your son or his wife, who would certainly not be in Perth. The Premier or his Lady could communicate with them and would doubtless see the little boy sent safely wth a family of passengers to your domicile, where he should arrive in the northern spring; this as a medical man you will see to be necessary.</p>
