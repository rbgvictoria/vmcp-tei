                     <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>M had evidently misunderstood the situation in the Académie. Alphonse de Candolle had indeed once been a Corresponding Member but in 1874 he had been advanced to the rank of <seg style="font-style: italic; ">associé étranger</seg>, one of the only eight allowed for in the statutes of the Académie. Hence his death did not create a vacancy for a Corresponding Member of the Botany Section. M had to wait for a further year before he was elected, following the death of the Berlin botany professor Nathanael Pringsheim.</p>
               </note> It was gratifying to me also, that now I learn of the safe arrival of Notoryctes typhlops. If you knew, what enormous exertions I made to obtain a specimen, then you will understand my anxiety about its safety. I will send you by the "Australien" some more eggs of Austral Birds and many other things, and hope to have by that time also the cross-section of a stem of Nuytsia floribunda and roots for Prof van Tieghem. You shall have something by each voyage of the "Australien".</p>
