               <seg style=""> but I am particularly glad, as one of the most extensive personal investigators of the Australian flora, on which again directly or indirectly its fauna depends, that so large, and so hilly, and therefore naturally so secure an area, is set apart for this enlightened purpose. But I pointed out to your distinguished Premier that it provides only for the flora of the most south-western part of your large territory. The tropical latitudes are not much in danger of any of its organisms becoming extinct, as the vegetation extends quite across to Queensland in most particulars, but the largely peculiar vegetation of the sandplains towards the lower Murchison River and the prevailing endemic vegetation on the eastern slope of the hills towards York will still require reservation also, unless the costly, laborious, and precarious process is adopted, to transplant from these regions the very numerous species of plants not occurring in the area already reserved. Western Australia in its extra-tropic regions has a more endemic flora than any other of the Australian colonies, hence the need there for these timely reservations before their pristine vegetable features get defaced or quite obliterated, are more urgent in Western Australia than elsewhere on the Australian continent.</seg>
