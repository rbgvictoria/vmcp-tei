               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>This week’s mail, dear Mr Holmes, will take to you 26 species of Algs according to the list of those desired by you as wanting yet in your collection. These I was able to muster out of a considerable number of spare specimens, which Mr J Bracebr. Wilson placed at my disposal for interchanges of my public establishment. My generous and erudite friend in Geelong does not wish to extend his own collection beyond Australian species, as his time is much beset by the onerous and multifarious duties, devolving on him in the position of Principal of the Church of England Grammar School in Geelong, an appointment he has held since nearly 40 years! He kindly handed over to the vast herbarium commenced by me in 1839 (nearly one million sheets) valuable Algs, you so obligingly sent. Thus it comes, that I received just now from him your last letter to him<note xml:id="ftn1" type="footnote" n="1">

                     xml:lang="en">Letter not found.</p>
               </note> with a wish of his to act on it on his behalf. Your list, indicating what is needed by you yet, will further be utilized as opportunities may arise hereafter for distributing spare algs, the main-collection here containing only the series of typic forms. If however for monographic or any other special purposes you should need any particular Algs at any time, which may be available or represented in my collection, you could have fragments from the normal specimens here. Please tell me also, whether the Royal pharmaceutical Society of England needs anything particularly from here, which may be within my reach. Engaged in <seg style="">

Therefore remind me of any needs of it, should I forget or at any time be unable to fulfill wishes of the Society. 1893 required from my own hand about 6000 letters or their equivalents, and that even represents only one part of my varied duties in this young and pushing colony. </p>
