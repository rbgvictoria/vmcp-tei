Chatin into thinking he had been elected a Corresponding Member of the Académie des Sciences of the Institut de France; see M to L. Dejardin, 5 August 1895. He was not elected to the Academy until 1 July 1895. M is equivocating a little over the date of establishment of the institution. The Académie des Sciences was founded in 1666. It was suppressed in 1793 but re-established in 1795 as one of constituent units of the Institut de France, together with, among others, the Académie Française, established informally about 1629 and officially in 1637.</p>
