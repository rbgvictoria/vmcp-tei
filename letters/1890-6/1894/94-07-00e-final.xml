                  <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>In the western part of the dukedom of Schleswig and also on the coast of Shetland wild ducks are late in autumn, and after the breeding season are obtained for part of the winter food of the inhabitants there. These ducks, after having been prepared as for ordinary kitchen purposes, are put into caskets and immersed in vinegar. Thus, in the closed caskets the ducks will keep for many months, and when wanted afford delicious food, the smaller bones, softened by the acetic acid, being even consumable. It would appear that this process might well be employed here, and for various kinds of fowls. Where such on farms are reared in abundance for the market they could be sold to customers direct, as the contents of the caskets would keep, and could gradually be used in any household, the meat becoming particularly tender and the acidulous taste being quite pleasant. The ordinary difficulty of selling fowls— some are spoiled in the shops— would by the easy and readily appliable means above indicated be overcome, and an extensive and profitable special farming industry, not surrounded with difficulties, might be thus established in these colonies.</seg>
