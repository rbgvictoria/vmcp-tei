               </note> and I have looked with admiration at your colored drawings and got also the specimens. Three sets have been received of the paintings, two being duplicates, the third (a smaller one) being unique. The number of the dried fungs is only 15. I would like to learn, whether you wish me to send the specimens and a complete set of the drawings, now received, to Kew, as on a former occasion. The final naming would doubtless be done there by Mr Massee, who gives at Kew his time completely up to the study of fungs. But I am quite certain, that no publication of your paintings could be brought out, as chromo-lithography is very expensive and as the sale of such a publication would be very limited, and no publisher would undertake it, unless a large subsidy was coming forward. So no monetary profit could arise to you. But some few novelties might be brought out from your collection in the "Grevillea", an illustrated periodical chiefly devoted to fungs, issued monthly in London. It so happens, that <seg style="">
