Williamson to M, 30 December 1893, that appears to be answering Williamson's question in that letter about the plant organs that he had labelled 'B' that he was sending to M. The fragment is dated on this basis to early January 1894. Its location suggests that it may have been a draft, or was not sent.</p>

There may originally have been additional text preceding what we now have.</p>
               </note>The minute organs B are the bracts along the rachis of a very young spike. Well developed fruits would be very conspicuous. The weather may have been unfavourable during the principal flowering time, and thus the plant did not produce fruits this season</p>
