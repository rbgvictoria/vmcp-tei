This felicity Providence has bestowed upon our most gracious sovereign Queen Victoria, by the marriage of her Royal Highness the Princess Victoria, second daughter of the Duke of Saxe-Coburg (Edinburgh) to the Grand Duke of Hesse, at Coburg today. The telegraph lines have flashed to us that great preparations have been made for the nuptial and that on arriving at Coburg Her Majesty received a most brilliant reception, at which she became moved to tears.</seg>

It was only becoming on the part of a colony bear Her Majesty's illustrous name to pay homage to the Royal Bride and Bridegroom and to wish for the happiness of the rejoicing couple. It was further significant of the happy and prosperous reign of Her Majesty that co-incident with this marriage was the public announcement of the betrothal of a third Grand Daughter (the Princess Alix) to the Grand Duke Nicholas of Russia, the Czarawitch.</seg>
