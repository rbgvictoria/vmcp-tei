               </note> reliable advice is afforded on grass culture also, and it is preferable to choose grasses of other kinds for feeding purposes to rear on sandy pastures away from the coast. As, however, Mr. Avery can rear just one head of cattle to each acre of Marram plantation for five months in the year, and as, at all events, the spikes with mature seed could be cut off for stable fodder from coast-Marram, you may find his letter worthy of insertion in your excellent periodical. It is found that in Australia, Marram plants, when sent to long distances, even though they are withered and look lifeless, will still sprout again from the roots. Have you any seeds of superior Melons and Pumpkins to spare for me.<note xml:id="ftn4" type="footnote" n="4">

Roots were offered the Agricultural Department, Bengal, for experiments on the sea coast, but as no use could be found for them, they were planted in the Society's Nursery; but, instead of starting into growth, perished. A quantity of seed was presented to the Zoological Gardens and a fair crop of herbage resulted, which appeared to be relished by some of the cattle in the gardens; the plants, however, perished later. Melon and Pumpkin seeds were sent as desired.'</p>
