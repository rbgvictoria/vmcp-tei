Stirling, 'The recent discovery of fossil remains at Lake Callabonna, South Australia', <seg style="font-style: italic; ">Nature, </seg>28 June 1894, pp. 206-11, p. 208. The letter is dated to 1894, as the expedition was in the field in the last part of 1893 and it is likely that the exchange with M was not until early in 1894. </p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>[Associated with the skeletons of Diprotodon, in a relative position which corresponded with that of the abdominal cavity, were occasionally found loosely aggregated globular masses of what I judge to be the leaves, stalks, and smaller twigs of some herbaceous or arboreal plants. The fragments are very uniform in length, thickness and character, rarely exceeding an inch in length or a line in thickness. They are solid, often irregularly branched, frequently retaining portions of the bark, and have their ends often frayed or crushed as if by the action of teeth. Microscopic examination showed the structure of the sclerenchyma tissue to be well preserved, and gave clear indication of the existence of dotted ducts, but I could find no trace of leaves that might have indicated a diagnosis. Judging from this entire absence of leaves and from the degree of maceration, or entire absence of the bark, these masses probably represent the contents of the intestines. No traces of coprolites were anywhere met with.</p>
