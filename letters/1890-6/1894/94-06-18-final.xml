                     <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>Baron von Mueller has lived to see his predictions verified and one more fairy tale of science translated into hard historic fact. Has he not impressed upon the Government again and again that there are whales in these Southern seas, gigantic creatures bearing untold wealth in whale bone, blubber, and ambergris within their oily hides? Has he not urged the Government to fit out an expedition for Antarctic exploration and send steamers away to search for the South Pole and bring back enough sperm oil to lift the colony out of its depression? And yesterday two genuine whales, varying in length, according to the estimate of frenzied onlookers, from 50ft to 150ft each, having entered Port Phillip Heads from the mystic shores of Guam, found their way up the bay in open disregard of Captain Fullarton's wrath and all the Marine Board regulations, and finally brought up a mile or so below the Gellibrand lightship … The boatmen of Williamstown are noted for their intrepidity. They will face the fury of the elements or the abuse of an overcharged passenger with the same calm and steadfast courage. The fact that they had never seen any whales … could not damp their ardour. Someone remembered hearing of an ancient mariner who had once wielded the harpoon … The veteran needed no pressing invitation, … [and soon] a wicked-looking whale-boat [with Hansen, the harpoonist, and five oarsmen] was rounding the breakwater pier … The value of an auxiliary steam service forced itself upon the oarsmen at an early stage and it was found far pleasanter to glide along in the wake of the steamer Acis … the harpooner took his station in the bow of the Acis, leaving 60 fathoms of good Manilla rope lying in the tub of the whaleboat, with one end made fast to the harpoon and the other to a stout post amidships … the lust of the chase was kindled in [the men], and the fierce desire for blood, or blubber, took possession of them … The whaleboat got easily within 50 yards of [the whales], but Mr Hansen reserved his fire until point-blank range … the harpoon itself might have been a little newer, but Mr Hansen … balanced his rusty iron with an air of confidence that was not devoid of grace … the harpoon sped home, the line flew out from the tub with a "sizz" … and whale and whaleboat were off like a train in the direction of Geelong … after twenty minutes … the whale … was going faster than ever. Suddenly he stopped … [then] <space unit="chars" quantity="1"/>made a sudden bound, and the rope … snapped like a piece of thread, leaving five crestfallen mariners in a waterlogged boat … [a second harpoon] glided off the creatures side … the "humpback" incontinently assumed the offensive … getting well underneath [the Acis] he gave her one smack with his tail which canted her first to port and then to starboard … the Acis left the scene. In the afternoon the chase was resumed by the whaleboat, towed first by the steamer Hope and afterwards by the Customs launch, which went out in charge of Mr James Martin to see that no lives were sacrificed in establishing the new industry. …[But it] could not get near enough even for a deck hand to throw a boat hook at either of the tantalising monsters. As evening closed in a boat full of whalers tired and wet, but happy and hopeful still, put back to Williamstown, leaving the "humpback" lashing the waves in a paroxysm of delight at the result of the chase, which will be resumed this morning as soon as it is light.</p>
