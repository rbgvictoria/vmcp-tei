In my small establishment, which has no contingency vote, no seeds magazine can be kept, and no collector can be employed; but the Agricultural Department has large votes, and would likely be able to purchase the requisite quantity of the kitchen vegetable seed usually kept by Melbourne seedsmen. I shall be able to send you within the next few days seed of Indian millets, Indian pulses and other seeds of economic South Asiatic plants, freshly received; but they ought to be sown only after the frosty nights have passed. I have repeatedly — also in recent times — provided seeds for the Royal Horticultural Garden at Burnley, near Melbourne, so that at this planting season seedling of various kinds, suitable for South Gippsland, would be available there, more especially as the said gardens are subsidised by the Government.

The cereals have already received sufficient attention to enable bread-stuffs to be raised locally. Select cultures of various kinds can follow; but the main staple plants for sustenance must be relied upon in the first instance. Poultry should also be a great help to these young settlements, which for large pastoral stock may not be a fitting place. It would be well if I could have a personal call from you, so that all these important subjects might be discussed <seg style="font-style: italic; ">viva voce</seg>. —</p>
