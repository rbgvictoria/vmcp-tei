               <seg style=""> Antarctic exploration, and I got then convinced of the great interest you took in such enterprise. I had the hope that in Melbourne I should have been able to have formed a company that would have given the Antarctic a fair trial on merely commercial lines, but owing to various circumstances I did not succeed. However I could not give the idea up, and on my return to Norway a couple of months ago I laid my plan before Commander Foyn, who with his usual energy and push has determined to take the first risk on certain conditions, viz.:—He expects that the Australian Governments—or the Victorian Government only—will grant him a bonus for thus trying to open up a new source of wealth, from which the colonies no doubt in particular will reap the best benefit, and at the same time Commander Foyn declares his willingness to let one or two of your scientific men follow the vessel if your Government or the Geographical Society should choose to do so, it being, however, distinctly understood that the presence on board of these representatives of science must not interfere with the expedition as a commercial enterprise, on which basis only Commander Foyn is prepared to send his vessel. At the same time you may easily conclude that there will be a number of opportunities for those scientists to make valuable observations, soundings, &amp;c. and they may be sure that on board they will be met with all due consideration and assistance from captains and officers' side, so as to enable them to get a profitable result of the voyage. The vessel that Commander Foyn intends to send for the purpose is a ship of about 400 tons register, extremely strong built and provided with powerful engines of about 90 to 100 h.p., in fact the very best type of her class, and I do not hesitate to say that the colonies will hardly ever get a better chance to have the Antarctic problem solved than the offer now made by Commander Foyn. It is besides very difficult to find any one single man who is ready to undertake a risk of this nature, and I do hope that your Government will make him an encouraging offer of bonus.</seg>
