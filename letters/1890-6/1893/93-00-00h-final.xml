For nearly forty years, the present writer has been in correspondence with him, and of late years hardly anything has happened with such regularity as the receipt on every Monday morning of one or more communications of some kind from Baron <seg style="font-variant: small-caps; ">von Mueller</seg>. Two or three such communications were received weekly on the average, but the number has occasionally mounted up to as many as seven and even nine! The last of these communications utilised in this journal was one on a new Musa from New Guinea, printed in our last issue, p. 360 [B96.09.01]. Since then, indeed, on Monday last, we received an original sketch of the inflorescence of this plant (fig. 85), which we now reproduce on p. 467, not only for its own sake, but <seg style="font-style: italic; ">in memoriam</seg> (p. 466).</p>
