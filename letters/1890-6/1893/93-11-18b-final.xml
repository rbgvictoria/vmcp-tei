               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>I generally put the cattle into the Marram grass enclosure after the first rains we get in April, and then allow them to graze there until the season begins to get too dry, when they are taken out and kept off till next season. I have been able to keep them in longer this season on account of the late rains we have had. During the last season I have had about 100 head of cattle grazing on about 100 acres of Marram grass for six months, and the cattle kept in fair condition during that time. There seems to be some doubt in the minds of a great many persons who have heard about Marram grass that it is of no value as a fodder, but I can assure you that the cattle at Port Fairy thrive well on it, and if it was not for this grass during the winter months the resident's cattle would fare badly. I am of the opinion that it would make a splendid ensilage.</p>
