The letter is introduced by the following remarks: ‘Many of the citizens of Melbourne at the present day do not know and perhaps have not heard of John Henry Brooke (<seg style="font-style: italic; ">Hansard</seg> not being a state school book). He was a prominent member of the Legislative Assembly nearly 40 years ago. He invented the “occupation licenses” in conjunction with Mr. J. M. Grant, and brought them into operation when Minister of Lands in the Heales Ministry of 1860-1. What may now be considered one of his most useful acts of administration was his “permanently reserving” the Royal-park. The fact was lately commemorated by the park trustees by resolution, which was forwarded to Mr. Brooke, who has for many years lived in Japan. His reply, sent to us through Dr. Black, of St. Kilda, is as follows:—‘.</p>

Pray convey to them my hearty acknowledgment of their most friendly consideration, and I hope that the time may never come for the Royal-ark to be alienated from the beneficial purposes for which it was reserved, for the use and pleasure of the present and future generations.</p>
