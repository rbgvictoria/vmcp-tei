               </note> You will hardly credit it when I say that my letter-book for the first half of 1893 shows 2480 official letters or equivalent of letters as written nearly all by my own hand ... they are all pertaining to official subjects professionally, irrespective of several hundred letters on Geographic subjects, charities etc. So you all will not judge me harshly when I write so rarely. My working hours being on an average 16 daily, and I have strained my visual powers with the microscope for more than 50 years. When you write to your sisters and brothers kindly excuse my taciturnity to them. I would like to have the exact address of all of them, who have a household of their own, as I might send then at this favourable season some seeds for their gardens. Kindly pick up for me a flowering sprig of any plant, on which pasture animals delight to feed. Such notes would enrich the 9th edition of my work on "Select Plants" to be brought out early in 1894.<note xml:id="ftn4" type="footnote" n="4">
