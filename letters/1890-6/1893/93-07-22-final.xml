                           <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>The bare, shifting sand hummocks of our coast range have in a few years by means of this wonderful grass [marram grass] been for miles transformed into hills of verdure, and influential visitors to the town have been greatly impressed by this transformation of sand wastes into beautiful green rolling downs. The consequence has been that intelligence concerning the alteration effected has been disseminated far and wide, one of the principal factors in the transmission of the information having been the Government Botanist, Baron Ferd. von Mueller, under whose enthusiastic direction the grass was first introduced to the colony and planted on Port Fairy seaboard. Through the Baron's agency, this season, applications for a supply of the grass have reached the local borough council from Natal, in South Africa, and from Albany, in West Australia; whilst at the last meeting of this council, on Wednesday evening, a whole batch of letters were read, all preferring requests that some of the remarkable grass might be forwarded to the writers, the quantities asked for ranging from 1 ton to a single pound. These communications came from the most remote parts of the continent, ranging from Charters Towers, in North Queensland, to Goolwa, in South Australia, residents in Tasmania likewise joining in the demand for the plant.</seg>

               <seg style=""> While most gratefully recognising the most kind sentiments of yours, I would like to say that I carried out also in this instance, after personal inspection there, merely a duty devolving on me in the official position which I have the honour to hold. But I avail myself of this opportunity further to add, that very high praise is due to the enlightened measures of your local council to giving practical effect to this particular introduction, and, further, ample recognition is due to the intelligent and persevering efforts of so able a cultivator as your Mr Samuel Avery. Had it not been for his exertions, the little I have done would have been of no avail to my fellow colonists there.</seg>
