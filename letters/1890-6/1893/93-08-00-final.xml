Baron von Mueller, in a letter to him, had said that the loss of Mr. Bailey’s services to Queensland would be a loss to the world, as regarded the work which the Baron and Mr. Bailey were at present jointly carrying out. The result would be that the work they had in hand might not be issued for many years, which would be a great loss, not only to this colony, but also to the rest of Australia.]</p>
