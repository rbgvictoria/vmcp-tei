               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>I had no idea of the very high value of the somewhat saline land there, when I advised trial cultures of the best of the salt-bushes. On such high-priced lands some sorts of kitchen vegetables could probably be reared profitably, and the test would be an easy one. It is difficult to predict what particular kitchen plants could successfully be grown on the land in question, unless a chemical analysis of the particular soil of the spot is extant. Some sorts of cabbage, asparagus, beets and peas are among those which hold out promise in this special case, and would all give a quick return, whereas such plants as the Date-palm, though likely fit for the locality, would yield an income after a series of years only. It seems to me, however, that any kind of plant of prominent utility might on a small scale be tried, except, of course, those which have already proved unsuited to the locality. It is impossible to foretell what will succeed and what will not: results are often surprisingly against anticipations. The difficulty of disposing of select vegetables at so great a distance from markets might be overcome by various modes of preserving, so as to be available for distant centres of population by export. In the warm Murray region, moreover, any kinds of kitchen vegetables would be accessible for the southern markets much earlier than those raised here. Thus, then, sales at higher prices could likely be effected in the metropolis for such early products than would be realised later in the season, just as table vegetables and fruits are brought earliest of all each season at a premium from the Channel Islands to the London market, and thus the lands in those islands have become of exceptionally high value. Let me kindly know what you think of these preliminary suggestions, so that, if needful, they can be further followed up.<note xml:id="ftn2" type="footnote" n="2">
