Garrick sent Thiselton-Dyer's letter of 16 September (draft at ff. 43-4) 'to the colony for the information of the Chief Secretary' (f. 45). Thiselton-Dyer also wrote on 15 December to Sir Robert Meade, Permanent Secretary at the Colonial Office, (draft at ff. 51-2). Bailey was reinstated at a reduced salary on 1 January 1894, and wrote on 7 February 1894 (ff. 53-4) to thank Thiselton-Dyer for his support: 'nothing which has ever been done by an Australian Government has caused such universal dissatisfaction, the press and the people from all parts of Queensland wrote and waited upon the members to try and prevent the abolishment of my office, but it was of no use until your letter was sent out by the Agent General'.</p>
