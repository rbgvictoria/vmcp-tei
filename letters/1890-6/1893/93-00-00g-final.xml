The article concluded '<seg style="">it will, therefore, be perhaps well if someone will obtain a few of the roots from the above mentioned source as their introduction in this colony might be of infinite value to a number of the large stockowners on the coast stations'.</seg>

               <seg style=""> were received from Baron Sir F. Von Mueller a few months ago and have been planted in the neighbourhood of Busselton. The plants are looking strong and healthy and there is every prospect of this useful grass becoming in a few years' time as great a benefactor to our sandy wastes as it has proved in the sister colonies.]</seg>
