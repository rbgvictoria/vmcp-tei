McKay to M, 1893 (in this edition as 93-00-00c), but it is apparently not that letter to which M is replying here, although the part questioning the production of barilla was not answered in M to N. McKay, 1893 (in this edition as 90.00.00d), which was reported to be the answer to McKay's letter.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>As regards barilla, I fear the gain would not be satisfactory, considering distance of soap factories from the source of supply, value of land, cost of cultivation, extraction and crystallisation. Early vegetables would likely be the best paying crop. I mean 'early' from your warmer region, sent to cooler places in Victoria. Could the freight be calculated? It might not, perhaps, be too high for supplying several cities of Victoria with the raw vegetables first of all in the seasons. I might add that even in countries where barilla has been produced for centuries from the ashes of maritime plants, it is now difficult to render the article now payable on account of its being manufactured from chloride of sodium very extensively. But by all means let a local experiment be made on a small scale with all kinds of saline plants: the advantage of rearing culinary vegetables would, however, be that the product could at once be turned from the field to monetary account. Not so with a harvest of barilla plants. I will readily discuss this promising subject further, if desired.<note xml:id="ftn2" type="footnote" n="2">
