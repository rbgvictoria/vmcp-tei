               <seg style=""> and the third, with hairlike leaves, which, in the absence of flowers or seeds cannot be named. All are evidently ground growing, and it is easily understood that it must be difficult to subdue them. When cut or pulled they would soon grow again from their perennial roots. It would be particularly difficult to uproot them completely. You doubtless employ some sort of cutting apparatus or dredge rake, or some other ingenious contrivance. If the plants could be fed down by some aquatic birds, living on vegetable food, sufficiently that would obviate other procedure more or less expensive and effectual. In a small lake near Richmond some few white swans cleansed it soon from all water weeds. Your lake is so large that it would need many of these animals for such a purpose; still as they are favorable, if not already in good number there, it might be worthy of consideration whether this method could be tried. Anyhow, up rooting is needed to effect a lasting clearance. Have you tried whether cattle will feed on these plants? If so, some help might be had from these animals for your purposes there by driving them into the shallows. I should like to see flowering and fruiting specimens of the plant with the hair-like leaves—thinnest of the three. — </seg>

The Ballarat Fish Protection Society recently wrote to the eminent botanist, informing him that Lake Wendouree was over-run with weeds, and asking it he could suggest a remedy. The Baron seems to have shaken his fat sides with laughter at the opportunity thus opened to him. He wrote back, informing the fishermen that the weeds were </seg>

The idea of keeping a small herd of dairy cattle upon Lake Wendouree is too delicious. We frankly admit that our united staff couldn't have devised a finer joke. Baron Von Mueller, after this, is fairly entitled to be dubbed the old lady of the lake (with apologies to Scott).</seg>
