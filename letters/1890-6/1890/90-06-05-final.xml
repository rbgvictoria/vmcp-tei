Lindt to M, 3 June 1890 (in this edition as 90-06-03a), with A. Macdonald to J. Shillinglaw, 6 June 1890, also written on the same sheet (box 243/1, Shillinglaw papers, La Trobe Australian Manuscripts Collection, State Library of Victoria, Melbourne). Macdonald asked Shillinglaw 'to let me have your views regarding Mr Lindt's proposal at your early convenience'. Shillinglaw returned the sheet with his reply added to it on 9 July 1890: 'I do not see my way to agree to this Proposal I think it would lead to difficulties with the Treasurer who might object to the Govt grant to the Society being so expended'. See also M to A. Macdonald, 12 June 1890 and C. Scott to M, 17 June 1890.</p>
               </note> I should not be disinclined, to give Mr Lindt my support in this proposition, as he does not ask a very large sum, and as he may accept less, in the first instance and a subsequent payment might be made on his return. Doubtless he would give us an interesting account of his voyage, as he is a ready writer. I wish at once to state, that I have departmentally no interest in this expedition, as the coast-vegetation is almost uniform through Polynesia and as very high mountains will not come within reach of Mr Lindt and his likely companion neither of whom know anything about plants.<note xml:id="ftn2" type="footnote" n="2">
