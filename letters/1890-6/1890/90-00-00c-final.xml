There was much discussion over the potential merits of the plant as a resource or whether it was a menace that should be declared a noxious weed, and many reports were made, many of which are summarized in the source article. The letter has been dated to 1890 on the basis that this is the latest year in which it could have written, but it may have been in the previous year: see <seg style="font-style: italic; ">South Australian register</seg>, 16 July 1889, p. 7, where the report of a meeting of the Central Branch of the SA Agricultural Bureau held on 15 July 1889 includes the following:</p>

                     <seg style="">, Government Analyst, wrote as follows :— 'I have gone through the correspondence of the committee appointed by the Royal Agricultural Society to consider the properties of stinkwort, and conclude that there is very little chance of this plant being utilized commercially. A full chemical investigation of its properties and of the properties and uses of the products which might be derived from it would be very costly, and to be exhaustive should be entrusted to specialists who have the necessary apparatus for extracting and the means of determining the value of the different products; such specialists are not to be found in the colonies. The oil and resin might be extracted from a ton or two of the plants and sent to England to have their value determined. This might probably be done at a cost of from £10 to £20. Special apparatus would be required.</seg>

Its advantages are so trifling in comparison with its disadvantages that it should at once be exterminated, or at least kept in check.
