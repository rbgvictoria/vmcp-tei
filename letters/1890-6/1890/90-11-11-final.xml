To maintain under such circumstances the needful discipline and unity of purpose, all members of the party must be under the absolute control of the Leader, and all must share in the general work of the field. Any deviation from this well recognized principle would introduce a disturbing element into the enterprise, which may prove disastrous to the whole.<note xml:id="ftn3" type="footnote" n="3">

               </note> The opportunities for collecting can in an expedition, the main objects of which are geographical, also only be very limited, so that no delays occur, and that the lines of the exploration may cover within the season as much of the blank spaces on the map as possible. Let it be considered also, as fully pointed out to Mr Gipps of the N.S.W. geographic Council, that the mere Salary of any one in the party is only a small fraction of the expenditure, which will arise to the noble originator and sustainer of the enterprise for each individual member of the party, to provide for locomotion, protection and sustenance. You will deem it also but just that the first series of specimens of any kind, resulting from the expedition, should fall to the share of institutions in that colony, which through one of its leading Residents provides the whole means for the contemplated exploit, in this instance S.A., with which from 1847 to 1852 I was as a settler also identified. The monetary question is however not raised, but equality of footing as regards all members of the party insisted on. The geographic Council of Victoria has already shown itself very favorable to the appointment of Mr Helms as a zoologic Collector, provided that he enters as an ordinary officer of the Expedition, subject to all the conditions imposed on the other members of the party. But you will understand, that no definite engagements can be made in any direction, until Sir Thomas Elder has approved of or altered the propositions, which have been submitted to him in a letter, sent two weeks ago.<note xml:id="ftn4" type="footnote" n="4">
