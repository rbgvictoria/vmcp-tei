The first was by J. Lindt on his ascent of the Tanna volcano in the New Hebrides and the second was by the Rev. D. Macdonald on the condition of affairs in that group.

In the meantime, he urged that Australia should insist upon the spirit of the existing convention or joint protectorate being wholly observed, so that in every respect British subjects in the New Hebrides should be placed on an equal footing with the French, and that France must either grant Australia her rights or recede from the convention.'

Mr. Macdonald, who unfortunately against my special request drifted into politics, had read his remarks, I at once rose; and emphaticallly gave it as my opinion, "that I was convinced, the French Government would with sanctity see the convention maintained, entered into with Britain, and that I felt also sure, the Government of the French Republic would remove any difficulties and any causes, which might lead to injustice or hinder progress of settlement, if clearly pointed out."</p>
