               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>The Hon. Mr Deakin, Acting Minister of Agriculture, sent for me last Thursday &amp; had a long interview regarding my department. He recognised, first of all, that instead of being a temporary appointment, as it is under the Bonus system, it ought to be a permanent one. You understand that I am appointed Consulting Vegetable Pathologist under that heading of the Bonus Regulations where it is stated that "The Governor in Council may from time to time engage persons temporarily &amp; during his pleasure", &amp; at present I am only supposed to devote my spare time to the subject, but Mr Deakin considers it, quite as entitled to an independent position, &amp; even more so, than the office of Government Entomologist.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>The next question that came up for consideration was, as to what department the Vegetable Pathologist ought to be connected with. I considered that it properly belonged to the Government Botanists Dept &amp; it is on that matter that I now specially write you. Mr Deakin here spoke of your invaluable services to the Colony &amp; hoped that you would long be spared to serve the Government further. I may explain that the Hon. Mr Deakin is personally very favourable to me, &amp; can hardly believe that it is six years since I delivered my letter of Introduction to him, &amp; that the Colony had only begun to utilise my services, at least in a Government capacity. Also I would like to point out that I have already applied for a Laboratory &amp; Museum, as well as a Library in connection with Vegetable Pathology, &amp; their desirability &amp; utility has been conceded. The buildings for these purposes to be located where the Old Training College (Mr Topp's) now stands.<note xml:id="ftn2" type="footnote" n="2">

               </seg> to attend to Vegetable Pathology, it would simplify matters considerably &amp; he (Mr Deakin) could then proceed with the permanent appointment.
