               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>Altho' abundance of land is available for rural settlements yet in the lowlands of Victoria, it seems deserving of attention, that the occupation of sub alpine vallies would afford advantages, so far, as to provide hardy fruits and vegetables til much later in the season than from elsewhere here. Furthermore in the highland-glens water is hardly anywhere wanting even naturally refertilizing for irrigation, and in the cool clime dairy-products, kitchen-vegetables and table-fruits could be raised as articles of particular local excellence. I would further beg to point out, that many ruralists, particularly those from the Scottish highlands, Scandinavia and Switzerland might prefer to settle in a clime, similar to that, to which they were accustomed. Anyhow, when the lower lands of Victoria will have been more fully taken up, settlement of the less frigid portions of our Alps is sure to follow. It seems further worthy of consideration, that by the establishment of many habitations in the subalpine regions here, tourists will in far greater number visit our own wide alpine tracts than before; and what is of far greater importance still, miners will be encouraged, to explore much more for their purposes, when they can more cheaply and more readily replenish their supplies, and are not left so much in loneliness as now.</p>
