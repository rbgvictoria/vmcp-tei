               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>It was to me a most pleasing surprise, dear Mr. Woodward, to learn from you that the West Australian Natural History Society already has conferred on me so great a distinction as to elect me an honorary member. I recognise this mark of generosity all the more as no opportunity could have arisen to me for rendering your highly promising union as yet any aid or service. Let me, however, at once remark that the flora of West Australia has had a fascinating interest to me throughout my whole scientific career, on account of its extensive elegance and endemism. Fully 50 years ago, I had the opportunity of seeing many West Australian plants growing in Continental University gardens, and as early as 1846 I had access to the large collections of dried plants brought from your colony by L. Preiss.<note xml:id="ftn2" type="footnote" n="2">

                     <seg style="">M would have seen Preiss’s plants in Hamburg, either at the botanic garden where the director, J. G. Lehmann, was co-ordinating the description of them in </seg>

                  </p>
               </note> It is not saying too much when I assert that this had a leading influence on my choice of Australia for emigration in 1847, when I had, as a sufferer from phthisis, to seek a winterless clime. Eight years later, I entered with Gregory, as an explorer, West Australian territory, and since then I have had opportunities, and through resources of my own, to be a witness of the attractiveness of the West Australian forms of vegetation in all their glory and grace, and it is with some pride I look to one of my best achievements in life, that of being identified as an elucidator of the vegetation, perhaps through every square mile of the great Western portion of Australia.</p>
