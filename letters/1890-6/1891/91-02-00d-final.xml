               <seg style=""> the great glaciers at Mount Cook, one of which was named nearly thirty years ago after Sir Joseph Hooker. They are among the hugest ever raised in the world. They are now easily accessible, as the gradually rising plains on which, coming from the east, the majestic chains of the southern Alps are approached, extend in some places actually to the foot of some of the glaciers. Nevertheless, these plains, and even the lower ranges, unlike to the country on the western side of the Alps, are altogether treeless, and even mostly bushless. The requisites, therefore, are trees for timber and fuel in these parts of New Zealand, and they should be necessarily of kinds comparatively quick in growth. <name key="Pinus%20insignis">Pinus insignis</name> and <name key="Cupressus%20macrocarpa">Cupressus macrocarpa</name>, which among Conifers I was the first to distribute on an extensive scale through Australia in the fifties and sixties of this century, are mostly utilised also in New Zealand, particularly the former for masses of woody growth, but of course more for shelter and fuel than for timber; and they cannot be relied on in the coldest regions where the many Canadian, Himalayan, and some of the Japanese trees, whether coniferous or otherwise, would be a great boom, irrespective of British trees already much grown in these Islands. Indeed, it must be remembered that New Zealand is about as large as the United Kingdom, and that half a century hence — a period required for the generality of trees to attain their full growth — a vast population will be settled in the New Zealand Islands. Where the climate in the lowlands is so mild, the question of wood supply becomes a grave one. From Australia we cannot offer much for the vicinity of the Alpine region, because although the plains near the glaciers rise only to 2500 feet as a maximum, the cold descending current of air from such masses of ever icy mountains exposes the low country near them to abundant snowfalls during the winter months. Among Eucalypts, the best we can offer are E. Gunnii, E. coccifera, and E. urnigera; but they do not grow so quickly as many other congeners, nor is their timber the best. Pines must come from the colder regions of the northern hemisphere, and so must the best of other classes of trees. The greater the diversity of the sorts, tentatively introduced, the better, because it will only be after actual test in different geologic tracts and climatic regions, that the correct final choice can be made, as in those for southern latitudes some species of the trees become diseased, or do not thrive well, which prosper in N. Europe, N. Asia, and N. America. </seg>
