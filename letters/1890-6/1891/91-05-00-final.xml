The New South Wales Government has placed £2,000 on the Estimates for the purpose of the expedition, and on the Baron's special pleading Queensland has offered to contribute £1,000, and Victoria has also promised substantial assistance. In his letter Baron von Mueller says —] As all the Australian Colonies will benefit largely in their revenues and industries by opening up the Antarctic regions for whaling, sealing, &amp;c, none of the colonies ought to exclude themselves from supporting this. Our geographic honour is at stake. Kindly exert yourself in this grand and urgent cause.</seg>
