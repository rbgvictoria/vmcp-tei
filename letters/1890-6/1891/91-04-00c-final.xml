                        <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>It was rumored that the German curator of the Botanic Gardens, Northern Territory, would be likely to be appointed as successor to the late Dr Sohomburgk. This has evidently been a suggestion of Baron von Mueller's, who favors his own countrymen to the exclusion of colonials or British, and it was this practice of employing even sailors of his nation that resulted In his removal from Melbourne Botanic Gardens. Dr. Schomburgk may have acted differently, but he is an exception; and now that the Victorian Government botanist has attempted to rule the nominations to the Botanic Gardens of the colonies it is most probable that another German will be sent to take charge of the Northern Territory gardens In place of the other appointed to Adelaide. There will be little chance of position or employment for anyone not of the German race should this arranged appointment take place. There are many well-educated gentlemen fully competent in botanic knowledge who are more eligible here in Adelaide or the other colonies, and why not appoint one of them?</seg>

He is a capable botanist, and the Government are of opinion that he will make an able successor to the late Doctor. Baron Sir Ferdinand von Mueller, of Melbourne, was one of several authorities who recommended Mr. Holtze for the position.]</seg>
