               </note> is so far exhausted, that after some few months no copies will be left purchasable, as this work is getting more and more known and therefore the demand for it is commensurately increasing. Under these circumstances I would respectfully recommend, that an other new edition may be brought out as early as possible, and that for the sake of expediting the printing of the 8th Edition it may be issued for the Department by a private printing-firm. The Gov. Printing Office seems always so over-burdened with work, that the bringing out of a new edition would likely there require a very considerable time. I have also the honor to state, that the 8th edition will be enlarged by about 50 pages. It may also be right to remark, that there can be very little difference in the expenditure, whether the book is printed at the Gov. Establishment or at a private office, and I like also to say, that of the three Victorian editions one was printed by permission of the Minister at a private printing place,<note xml:id="ftn2" type="footnote" n="2">

This M did; see M to T. Wilson, 4 April 1891. See also C. Troedel &amp; Co. to M, 25 March 1891; Sands &amp; McDougall Ltd to M, 25 March 1891 (in this edition as 91-03-25a); and McCarron, Bird &amp; Co. to M, 1 April 1891 (in this edition as 91-04-01a). The work was published as B91.09.01.</p>
               </note> Of the vote for publishing works in the Governm. Botanists Department a sufficiency is left available, to carry the new edition through in the present financial year. I like to draw attention also to the fact, that the monetary outlay, which for this new issue will be incurred, proposed to be 1000 copies, will largely be recouped by sale of the book, irrespective of its becoming gratuitously available for public institutions.</p>
