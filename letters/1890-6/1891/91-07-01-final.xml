               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>For some time, my honored friend, I intended to write to you specially in reference to the sendings of Fungs for elaboration in England. After the lamented death of Berkeley, they went to Dr Cooke, usually direct, with an understanding, that a series of the specimens, so far as available, should be left at Kew, and a series be returned to my establishment. This has worked satisfactorily to all of us hitherto; but I think it right now to inform you officially of what you likely have learnt already indirectly, that Dr Cooke is engaged to write a descriptive volume on the mycology of Australia for which his thus far now unrivalled experience and his facilities at Kew he is specially suited.<note xml:id="ftn2" type="footnote" n="2">

Fungs done and printed in London; this succeeded by communicating not with the bot Gardens but with the agricultural Departments of the 4 colonies, and when I was consulted about it I gave it of course strenous support.<note xml:id="ftn6" type="footnote" n="6">

F. M. Bailey, Dr. Berggren, Mrs. Flora Martin, Baron F. von Mueller, F. Reader, Schomburgck, and others' (p. v) — with a more specific thanks to 'the perseverance of Mr. F. M. Bailey, Mrs. Martin and Baron F. von Mueller, in continuing to secure and forward specimens to England for identification' (p. vi). However, from vol. xvii of <seg style="font-style: italic; ">Grevillea</seg> on, Cooke indicated in his series on Australian fungi the species described from specimens sent by M by adding an asterisk before the species name, as well as giving details of the collector in parentheses at the end.</p>
