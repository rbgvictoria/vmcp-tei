Topp, the retiring president, to the Annual Conversazione of the Field Naturalists' Club of Victoria held on 28 May 1891. In the section of the address on the Antarctic expedition proposed to be undertaken by Baron von Nordenskiold, Topp used 'Information which I give on the authority and by the courtesy of' M. After summarizing financial contributions received from the Australian colonial governments and the amount to be given by Baron Dickson toward the total requirement of £15,000, Topp then quoted M as given here.</seg>
