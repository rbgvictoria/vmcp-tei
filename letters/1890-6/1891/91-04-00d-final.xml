Europeans ascended Mt Yule for the first time in 1891, during an expedition sponsored by the Victorian Branch of the RGSA; see M to A. Cogniaux, 28 March 1891 (in this edition as 91-03-28a). The specimens collected were in Melbourne by March, and some ferns were sent to Kew; see M to W. Thiselton-Dyer, 16 March 1891. Zoological specimens were not distributed until early April, after they had been displayed for members of the RGSA on 3 April; see M to C. Hedley, 7 April 1891 (in this edition as 91-04-07b). Probably after the receipt of this letter, Ramsay appears to have appealed to Charles French for help. French supported Ramsay's request and reported to him that 'You may rely upon me trying my level best to have the birds <seg style="">
                        <hi rend="underline">at least</hi>
                     </seg> sent on to Sydney, and I shall "keep at" the Baron until he makes the promise, which I feel certain he will do' (C. French to E. Ramsay, 22 April 1891). French subsequently reported: 'I think I have pretty well settled the N. Guinea bird question, as I put it to the Baron this way, that you, as a scientific author in Ornithology, are as much entitled to receive <seg style="">
                        <hi rend="underline">all</hi>
                     </seg> N. Guinean Z. [Zoological] specimens, as he is to receive B [Botanical] specimens from the same place, and as he is, as you are aware, so jealous of anyone "dabbling" in N. Guinea plants, he of course could not resist my "<seg style="">
                        <hi rend="underline">logic</hi>
                     </seg>"? more especially as McCoy does not work on Ornithol.' (C. French to E. Ramsay, 2 June 1891) (both letters at ML MSS.563/3 E. P. Ramsay papers, Mitchell Library, State Library of New South Wales, Sydney). Despite its being filed between M's letters to Ramsay dated 18 November 1885 and 6 January 1886, the present letter is therefore dated to early April 1891 as the latest likely date that Ramsey could have approached M for bird specimens, for this reply to have been sent, and French to have intervened.</p>
