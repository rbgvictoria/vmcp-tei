Luehmann and French read a note and exhibited the skin of a tree-climbing kangaroo from Northern Queensland, new to science, to which they gave the name Dendrolagus Muelleri. This remarkable marsupial has a body about 2ft. in length, with a tail somewhat exceeding 2ft. The disproportion between the fore legs and the hind legs is not nearly so great as that of the ordinary kangaroo and wallaby; the toes are strong and curved, to enable it to climb tall and straight trees, on the leaves of which it exists. The species is more nearly allied to the one which was discovered a few years ago in Queensland than to the two species from new Guinea. The specimen shown was got from a straight tree, about 90ft. above the ground.'</p>

G.’) and French 'read a note on, and exhibited the skin of, a tree-climbing kangaroo from Northern Queensland'. No more detailed report was published in the journal. See also M to E.

               </note> As 2 spec. of this genus occur in New Guinea, two really distinct kinds may also inhabit N.E. Australia. We have no Dendrolagus in the Museum here for comparison. Have any of yours an approach to a brush-tail?</p>
