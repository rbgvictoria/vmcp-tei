The article is introduced: 'Bishop Nevill has received a letter from Baron von Mueller, president of the Victorian Geographical Society, on the subject of Baron Nordenskjöld's projected Antarctic expedition, which he has kindly placed at our disposal'.</p>
               </note>
               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>[Baron von Mueller states that he has received a cablegram intimating that the New Zealand Government decline to make any contribution towards the cost of the expedition, and expresses his surprise thereat, as by virtue of its geographical position New Zealand will derive the greatest advantage from the intended enterprise. He points out that Queensland, the most remote colony of Australia, has placed £1000 on the Estimates, and New South Wales £2000. Tasmania has promised £500, and South Australia and Victoria are almost certain to contribute. Even Western Australia will probably assist. He considers it so strange that the very colony most interested in the expedition—which is likely to lead in the near future to the development of whaling and sealing—should not be represented, that he asks Bishop Nevill, as one who took great interest in the subject, to bring the matter under the notice of the Otago M.H.R.'s and the public generally with the view of considering the best means to be adopted to assist the enterprise.]</p>
