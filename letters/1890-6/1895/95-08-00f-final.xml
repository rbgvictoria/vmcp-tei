I make this appeal once more as the spring sets in, because I cannot hope to pass through many vernal seasons more at this very late evening of my busy day of life. In return for such sendings as I perhaps now for the last time may ask for, I will forward fresh seeds of plants prominently useful and for a great part new to your colony.<note xml:id="ftn5" type="footnote" n="5">
