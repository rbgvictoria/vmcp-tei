                     <seg style="">Woolls died on 14 March 1893. </seg>The proof bound with the present letter is annotated in an unknown hand on p. 1: 'on pp 2 &amp; 3 are two of the so called errors we are told that there are other errors which he would not have left uncorrected and the Council were anxious his greatest friend should correct them all'. On p. 2, Woolls refers to W. Dampier's herbarium which he says 'is still preserved at Oxford and contains forty specimens, eighteen of which are figured in his <seg style="font-style: italic; ">Voyage</seg> (vol. III, ed. 1709), though few of them with the exception of <seg style="font-style: italic; ">Colutea Novae Hollandiae</seg> (Now <seg style="font-style: italic; ">Clianthus Dampieri</seg>), can be identified.' This sentence is marked by a line and '?' in the margin. On p. 3 Woolls refers to Joseph Banks's will in which he says Brown [i.e. Robert Brown (1773-1858)] was bequeathed 'an annuity of £200, and also the use and enjoyment during his life of the library, herbarium, manuscripts, drawings, &amp;c. He also bequeathed to F. Bauer (the eminent artist and companion of Brown who had been in Sir Joseph's employment for thirty years) an annuity of £300 on condition of his continuing to delineate the flowers at Kew.' A line and '?' straddles these two sentences in the margin. No other queries are marked, but later in the MS there are ticks in the margin beside several references to M's work. The artist is Ferdinand Bauer</p>
