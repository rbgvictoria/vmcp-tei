Shall the attention of the P. S. Bd be called to the clause in respect to Baron von Mueller, Mr Ellery &amp; Mr Hayter &amp; shall they be asked whether in each case they propose to issue a certificate for their continuance in the service?' Peacock<space unit="chars" quantity="1"/>replied<space unit="chars" quantity="1"/>on 18 December that the Board be asked to certify the continued employment of these men for three months. On the same day Topp instructed that a letter be written to the Board 'explaining that the Govt desire the extension to allow time for a full inquiry as to whether the work of the branches presided over by these officers can be properly carried on without increase of expense if these gentlemen are superannuated'.<space unit="chars" quantity="1"/>The Board certified that it was 'desirable in the interests of the Public Service' that M, Ellery and Hayter 'continue in the performance of the duties of their offices until the 31st.

Peacock requested a further extension to 31 December 1895 on 22 February 1895, on the grounds that M's work 'is of a specialised technical description and there are no other officers in the Public Service qualified to undertake it. … it is further desirable that Sir Ferdinand von Mueller should be afforded an opportunity of revising and completing his various works on economic botany' (X94/9345, unit 818, VPRS 3992/P,<space unit="chars" quantity="1"/>Public Record Office, Victoria).</p>

Baron von Mueller is entitled to a pension equal to about two thirds of his salary, and the saving that would be effected by his retirement would be so small that there is not the slightest likelihood of his being asked to relinquish his work, which is a labour of love to him.</p>
