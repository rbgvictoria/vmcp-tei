The Botany section of the Académie had positions for ten, not six, corresponding members. Several places were customarily allocated to botanists from other parts of France; leading international figures filled the remainder. Nathanael Pringsheim, professor of botany at the University of Berlin, died in October 1894 and M was elected as his replacement on 1 July 1895. Alphonse de Candolle's death in April 1893 had not created an opening for a new Correpsonding Member of the Botany section, since he had for many years held the much more exalted rank of <seg style="font-style: italic; ">Associé étranger</seg>.</p>
