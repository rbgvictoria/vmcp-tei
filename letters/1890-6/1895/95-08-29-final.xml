Besides some novelties would you with the help of Lady friends would persevere to collect Algs. Perhaps you have friends on other points of the coast, whom you could also induce to collect seaweeds. I will gladly send you and friends of yours also seeds of various highly useful plants some will be despatched by this weeks mail already. Others can follow, as they may ripen gradually.</p>

You can send one pound weight of specimens by post for some few pences. That is the simplest, quickest and cheapest mode of sending The postage can be repayed by me. Would aboriginal youths bring you specimens from distances in baskets fresh? You might send them a little<note xml:id="ftn1" type="footnote" n="1">
