                     <seg style="">.— H.T., Upper Everton, writes: — "Would you kindly classify the enclosed specimen of grass, which, I believe, were it better known, would be extensively cultivated for cattle fodder. It Is a prolific seed bearer; each seed throwing up an immense number of stems, thick and succulent, of which cattle are very fond, luxuriates in gravelly river flats, growing sometimes, under favorable conditions, to the height of 4 feet or more, and will even thrive in heaps of river gravel, placed in dry positions among the hills, or dry clay banks, appearing to resist heat well, as far as observed in the dry districts of the north-east. Very little moisture causes the seeds to germinate, sometimes in 24 hours, when its growth is very rapid. It will stand close feeding." The grass, Baron von Mueller informs us, is the Pannum Crux Galli, [typesetter's error for </seg>

The grain serves also well for small cage birds. This grass is of short duration, but it is always re-established readily from its dropping seeds.</seg>
