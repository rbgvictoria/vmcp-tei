The president paid a high tribute of praise to the valuable services rendered the colony by Baron Von Mueller in regard to economic plants, and in conclusion moved that a cordial rote of thanks be accorded that gentleman for the collection of seeds. The Rev. J. Garlick seconded the motion, which was supported by Mr. Bayne, and carried unanimously.' [Letter of thanks not found.]</seg>
