               </note> are pervading you. I recognize with much gratification also your desire of preserving feelings of attachment for the Institution, in which we worked so long together, and I feel sure that your career here will be of lasting beneficial influence on your future service also under the Government. We must all strive, when in a public position, to seek honor in placing our duties towards the state always above private personal considerations. We will then be kindly remembered also in futurity. To you such conception of our positions is all the more a sacred one, as you have young desendents, to whom you doubtless like to leave a high public status as an inheritage. Let me thank you for the services so long rendered me often regardless of your own interests, often also tendered to me outside of the precincts of State duties, and let me hope that divine providence will grant you a long series of years replete with pleasure with pride of your successes and with happiness in your family life.</p>
