Up to this time we have frequently lost our plants and plantings for want of proper space and protection; we are now trying hard to get up as full a collection as possible of the economic plants of the world. I will now also have some help from the dep't of Botany which under Prof. Greene's auspices devoted itself almost exclusively to the systematic botany of California, so that I had even to make my own determinations of any foreign plants. Prof. Setchell of Harvard, who succeeds Greene, is of a different mind and we will now be able to push the work more energetically.</p>
