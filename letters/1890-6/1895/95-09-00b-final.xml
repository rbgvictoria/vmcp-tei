The text given here is from a letter from William Mitten to the <seg style="font-style: italic; ">Gardeners' chronicle</seg>, 30 January 1897, p. 82 (B97.01.01), headed '<seg style="font-variant: small-caps; ">Ferdinand von Mueller</seg>'. Since M mentions Mitten's visit to the Alps, his letter is to be dated to after July 1895 when Mitten and his son-in-law Alfred Russel Wallace were in Switzerland; see Wallace to his wife Annie Wallace <seg style="font-style: italic; ">née </seg>Mitten, 7 July 1895, Natural History Museum, WP1/4/10(2). The earliest likely date after M would have learned of Mitten's return is September 1895, but his letter could have been sent at any time up to October 1896. Mitten introduced the text as follows: </p>

                     xml:lang="en">The news of the death of Sir Ferdinand Von Mueller came to me just as I was preparing to send him freshly-ripened seed of Elymus arenarius, which, after reading his success with Ammophila, I was about to ask him to try; having ascertained that the herbage of the Elymus is freely eaten, and, to all appearance, liked by the horse, it would have many advantages over the Ammophila in the production of food, as well as in its binding roots, and although the appearance and harshness of the foliage may seem unlikely, yet it is noted by Parnell that the Elymus contains more sugar than any other British grass, which may be a reason for the horse looking for more when it is offered to him. The last letter I received from Sir F. Von Mueller contains a hint of the probable occurrence on our coasts of an overlooked plant, and its entire contents are just in the style he usually employed: brimful of the enthusiasm which carried him through the work he accomplished, and built up his own monument. <seg style="font-style: italic; ">William Mitten</seg>. —</p>

If so, such would be well worth publishing in one of the home periodicals, as our knowledge of the geographic distribution of Australian Evasculares is still very imperfect.
