               <seg style=""> I will send you then a copy, the oil plants being easily found out by the index. As regards plants for pressing oil from seeds (not from pulp as in the case of the olive) a necessity presents itself to induce some enterprising man to set up an oil mill locally, and to insure from farmers an adequate supply of oil seeds to keep the mill going. An oil mill has recently been established in Melbourne, and it may therefore also be advisable to ascertain at what price oil seeds would be purchased by the owners of the mill here, and to what extent particular seeds respectively would be disposed of from your district. The farmers could then calculate how far the growing of any sort of oil plants there would prove remunerative. The "Select Plants" would give an insight into the prospects of any other new cultures therein</seg>

It would be a good plan for four ruralists to commence test cultures on a small scale for one season, the results of which would then be turned to safe account for further, more intensive and therefore commercial operations.
