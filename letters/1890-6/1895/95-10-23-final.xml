The text given here is from '</seg>Notes by the late Baron Sir Ferdinand von Mueller, K.C.M.G. on botanical collections', In ‘Annual Report on British New Guinea from 1st July, 1895, to 30th June, 1896’, p. 92 (Appendix Y) (B97.06.01).

                     xml:lang="en">A melancholy interest is attached to the notes from the late Baron Sir Ferdinand Von Mueller, as they are the last that can be furnished by him. They were not elaborated so fully as was intended, but it has been thought that they would be useful and of interest, even in their present form. One of the most cherished studies of that great and enthusiastic man of science was the flora of New Guinea, of which he possessed unique knowledge, and in which, especially in the alpine plants, he took the very deepest interest. His hearty, sympathetic, and faithful co-operation will be greatly missed in this important branch of research in connection with this new colony in a new and greatly diversified country.</p>
