As we experienced, the seasons vary greatly, &amp; if we had had in 1840-1 the weather we had in 1842-3, we should never have discovered Victoria Land, nor perhaps even have approached it. Then too it is quite clear, from Weddell's experience, that the pack moves its position over vast areas. Nevertheless I am inclined to think that the route south via E. coast of Victoria Land may be always more or less open, the currents being strong. As to wintering I extremely doubt the practicability of it, &amp; even if practicable, I cannot conceive any Commander undertaking the responsibility of leaving a party in such a climate of wind fog &amp; snow &amp; on such a coast, any part of which may be blockaded for years by Bergs or Pack, &amp; remain so for an indefinite period. Let Cape Adare be ever so acessable now, a square mile of Pack, or a couple of Icebergs stranded off it, might seal it up in a week for years. Graham's Land is the place to search for winter quarters.</p>
