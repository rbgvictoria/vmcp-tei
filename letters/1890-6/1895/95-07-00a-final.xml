Your kind allusions to my having shared by introductions from here through a long series of years, in adding to the rural riches of your territorial expansions, touches on subjects I count among the principal achievements — so to have exercised some influence on the geographic explorations in your extensive dominions, at a time when resources for the purpose were slender and facilities few.
