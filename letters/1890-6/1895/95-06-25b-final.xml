               </note> is for you to keep. I feel sure that I have it in the full volume of the Lund University. [...] Under no circumstances should you exert yourself specially to gather specimens for the Melbourne collection; only when you happen to get one of a kind not likely to be got here forward it to me. My pride is to demonstrate for all classes of Australian plants the geographical distribution; but if you incurred special toil for that it would disturb your happiness and might withdraw you from filial and domestic duties. I am afraid in your zeal you tax also your time too much for eliciting rural information such as you give now so well. Your note on the value of seaweeds for potato crops is significant. My idea is that algae should be collected fresh for manure, dried under roofs, without walls for free passage of air, be pressed when almost dry like wool into bales, when the weight would be so much reduced that railway freight or cartage would be of less consideration. Then also none of the valuable manuring ingredients would be lost by fermentation in the open air, and a new mercantile commodity be gained. For asparagus and many other kitchen vegetables algae is a good manure. We should not expect from manuring with algae or seagrasses destruction of the rust pullinia,<note xml:id="ftn5" type="footnote" n="5">
