               </note> approach 1000 lb in weight or weigh even more are extremely rare, so that as yet only one large specimen is in the whole of the United States (with Prof Goodale through me) — less than one dozen individuals of huge size having been seen by me in our primeval forests since 1847. Indeed I may never be able to find yet one of ½ ton weight, but I would likely succeed to find 2 of about 500 lb each, which if placed close together in any glass-house of yours would give a good idea of what the heaviest ever obtained, would be like. Then comes an other question, if you adopt this offer. As so rarely American Ships go straight home from here to Boston or any other harbour near you, would you have the means in your department to defray the freight from London across the atlantic ocean? I have no means in my establishment for sendings of this kind, and the heavy expenses for dragging out of some remote recess of the primeval forests and out of the narrow irrigated ravines, where only <name key="Todea">Todea</name>s and only rarely at all occur, would fall on my private slender resources and so the freight from here to London.</p>

Duplicates I never keep stored up, so I have always sent away for interchanges those spare specimens, which I got at any time. Do you attach in your Department value to resines, gums, kinos &amp;c Of such I could send samples occasionally. I am eager to remain in regular communication with you.</p>
