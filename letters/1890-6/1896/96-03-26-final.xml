                        <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>A representative of this Journal recently called on Baron von Mueller, the Government Botanist, who favored us with an interesting account received from California, regarding the success of Antriplex [Atriplex] Semibaccutum in the Alkali land. For years this land was nothing but a barren waste, until it was suggested by Baron von Mueller that they should try our Australian saltbush. He forwarded seeds of various varieties, but the above mentioned variety was the most successful. Now this land has rapidly increased in value, and is being sought after. Professor Hilgard, of the University of California, in a letter, dated March 26, 1896, makes the following remarks:—‘.</seg>

More extensive and long-term private experimentation, however, revealed that the celebration which accompanied the introduction of the saltbush was premature. The plant grew well on salty soils and was acceptable to sheep and fowl, but it would not be eaten by cattle. Having no practical value as a forage plant for cattle, it quickly fell into disrepute among farmers.</p>

Of course, I do not expect the plant to succeed in the severe climates of Montana and Dakota; but I have heard favorable accounts of it in Northern Utah, where the ground was frozen several inches deep. The present season will yield valuable information regarding the northern limits of its usefulness. For the present year we have been requested to send 500lb of seed to eastern seedmen.</seg>
