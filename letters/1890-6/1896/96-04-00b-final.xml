It has found its way to most of the winterless countries in the world now and so to us, and it occurs as an annual also in colder countries occasionally. It is a good acquisition to feeding grounds, particularly also gravelly river banks, and will even succeed to vegetate on brackish soil. In the variety with short bristles to the flowers it is not objectionable, but the form with long "awns" may get molesting to herds and flocks, the bristles adhering to fleeces and hides. This grass is not of individual long endurance, but as it ripens grains copiously, and as they easily germinate, this plant is keeping its position well, and ranges from season to season farther. Here it is available all the year round, and it is much relished by stock of all kinds.</seg>

It is widely dispersed through the northern hemisphere, and thus also indigenous to Britain, where it is known as the Brunelle. In our and the next adjoining colonies, it is also not uncommon, especially on springs and rivulets, or margins of swamps, but as it does not extend to Western Australia, it must be assumed that it was not originally indigenous to our part of the world. This herb was formerly in use medicinally, as an astringent, both externally and internally.</seg>
