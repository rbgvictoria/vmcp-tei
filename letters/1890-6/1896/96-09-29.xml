It will always be very pleasing for me to hear of you &amp; George although it is to be regretted that you cannot occupy both more favourable positions yet as you are able evidently to save something &amp; as you are seemingly to enjoy both good health you must be content for the present. The climate is no doubt delightful there during the cool season but you will find it dreadfully hot during the summer months. I hope you will be lucky then in your independent search for a gold-reef. If I can send you something from here that is within my reach it will be done with pleasure. The plants sent by you are very acceptable &amp; your mode of packing answers quite well. I will give you some information on the specimens when I feel a little better. This season I required particularly <seg style="">
                  <hi rend="underline">minute</hi>
               </seg> plants of which a great many kinds will be out from August till October. I send you some bag envelopes into each of which you can put a lot. Perhaps you can give some of them to intellectual friends. A quarter of a pound's weigh will only cost 2d postage. Every one shall have full credit in my works for discoveries made. Your dear mother sent me such nice cakes for my birthday. With my regardful remembrance of both of you.</p>
