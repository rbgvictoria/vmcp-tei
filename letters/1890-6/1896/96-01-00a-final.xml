Meanwhile they saw a large shark near the hoys, and the poor little fellows also saw the monster, hut they continued on. My son, who is a remarkably strong and fast swimmer, could have left the younger lad far behind, but in response to the latter's wish he kept by his side until within a short distance of the land when a wave separated them. My son landed at the feet of some gentlemen who were bathing, and who, up to that moment, knew nothing about the accident. The drifting boat was by this time nearly out of sight and could only be discerned by the aid of binocular. It so happened, however, that one of the gentlemen on the beach had a horse ready saddled, by the aid of which the Trial Bay Gaol, about a mile and a half distant, was soon reached, and the life boat sent to the rescue of Captain Grant and his man, who were brought in very much exhausted. It is admitted that they would have perished had it not been for the bravery and endurance of the boys.</seg>
