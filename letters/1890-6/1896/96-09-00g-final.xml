                  <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>At this season, when the flora of our colonies is in its native garb, it is particularly desirable to arouse the young Australians to a love of the flowers of their native country. When taught to observe the varied vegetation around their homes their faculties for observing are sharpened; their mind becomes more expanded; method, while the gatherings proceed, is instilled, and above all, religious feelings are heightened, because divine works in nature will lead to contemplations of godly admiration. If in wandering through natural flower fields plants are secured for close examination, sources of unexpected joy are suddenly opened up, and as collections increase they continually become enhanced in interest. There is an additional charm in these, recreative occupations throughout the interior regions of Australia particularly, as those distant regions are as yet imperfectly searched for plants, so that the enviable chances of discovering absolute floral novelties still exist. The task of collecting is one of the utmost facility, and equally easy in our dry clime is the process of pressing and drying specimens. Even if the species are not new, the material will serve for tracing still further the geographic distribution of many sorts of plants. For all this the amateur will get permanent credit in the works which emanate from such contributions. The </seg>
               <seg style="font-style: italic; ">minutest</seg>
               <seg style=""> plants should not be missed, as they herald, as well as the most gorgeous, the wisdom of the Divine Creator! It will be among them that the largest number of novel forms remains to be discovered. If duplicate sets are prepared and numbered, the names of the systematic various species will be furnished. The transit of small parcels as samples by post is easy and inexpensive. If at each of the family homes on stations the local plants were collected, not only would an additional and highly intellectual display be gained for the drawingroom, but also original and truly valuable information elicited therefrom.</seg>
