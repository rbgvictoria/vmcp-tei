               </note> dear Madam, has reached me, the one of the 17 Jan, and I feel very much indebted for the generous sentiments, which you evince towards me, and for the spirited exertions, made by you in the antarctic cause. All the more grateful acknowledgement is due to you, as your glorious achievements in floral art are absorbing so much time and thought and you should thus not be withdrawn from your own splendid and important engagements. We can all be sure that you will win new laurels in the incomparably rich flower-fields of South-Africa.<note xml:id="ftn2" type="footnote" n="2">

The Belgian expedition under Adrien de Gerlache de Gomery was first in the field, in the summer of 1897-8, but then became beset by ice and spent twelve months drifting in pack-ice, the crew thereby becoming the first humans to winter south of the Antarctic Circle. A German expedition under Erich von Drygalski and a Swedish expedition under Nils Nordenskiöld both headed south in late 1901 and spent the winter of 1902 in the field.</p>

               </seg> should still be got ready to operate in the farthest south next season (96-97) that its preparation and outfit be limited to 2 summers and one winter, so that only half the costs would be incurred, that Graham's Land, not so very far from S. Africa which has a good harbour and often open water, should be the basis of operation, that the South-African Government with which I communicated at the time of Lord Loch, should contribute to the expenditure, in which also probably N.S.W. and Victoria would share. All this could still be arranged preparatorily within the next few months, if S. Africa was communicated with by telegrams. Britain would thus not be forstalled! As for steamers the Scotish whaling and sealing vessels would serve well and have Commanders and Crews accustomed to ice-voyages.</p>
