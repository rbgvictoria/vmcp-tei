                     <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>A gentleman in this town wrote some little time back to Baron von Mueller, suggesting that a manual should be published containing the names of the more familiar wild flowers of the bush. It is a most unsatisfactory fact that none of our children are acquainted with the proper names of the richest flora of the world, following in this the example set by their elders. It is extraordinary that so little has been thought of this want in the past. In the United Kingdom almost everyone is familiar from earliest childhood with the names and characteristics of the flowers of bank and field. Those of Western Australia are equally interesting, and yet to ninety-nine out of a hundred persons they are nameless mostly.

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>Your thoughtful wish to have the more usual forms of Western Australian plants rendered known by their scientific names can be readily realised by the photo-zincographic or some other process now cheaply and quickly employed by illustrated newspapers and many other publications. I would be quite ready to name any specimens, if possible, both in flower and fruit, so that these could be used as the originals for the illustrations, and I could also give brief notes. The size of such issues need only be octavo, as for this popular purpose no analytic dissertation would be required, nor chromatography. Such issues could be by decades, and ten of them would form a fair volume. Even one single volume would give a good idea of most of your ordinary forms of plant life, but for your Public Library and Mechanics’ Institute should be acquired all my illustrated works, as they contain so many Western Australian specimens.
