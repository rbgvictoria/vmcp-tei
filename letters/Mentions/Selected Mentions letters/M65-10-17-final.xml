The text is preceded by a letter from Woolls to the editor of the newspaper explaining that he had been prompted to send Bentham's letter for publication by news of Bentham's death—a false alarm, as it turned out</seg>; see T. Caruel to M, 21 November 1881, and M to B. Jackson, 25 December 1881<seg style="">—in order to show 'that the venerable writer felt the immense difficulty of describing plants simply from dried specimens, and that he regarded the co-operation of Baron F. von Mueller as a matter of the greatest importance… [W]hilst the one had the means of examining the accumulated specimens which had been forwarded to Europe since the foundation of the colony, the other was able to furnish valuable descriptions from living plants, as well as copious notes respecting their peculiar habit and geographical range.' 'It is pleasing to think', Woolls continued, 'that these great men worked together so harmoniously for more than 16 years, and that they were permitted to bring to a satisfactory termination the seven volumes of our "Flora."'</seg>
