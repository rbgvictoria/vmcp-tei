               </note> on the subject and I fear that I failed to convince him of the great advantages which must follow from publishing such a work. General Sir Henry Lefroy, Royal Artillery, a man known widely for his scientific attainments in a letter dated 8th August last says: "I hope you will succeed in persuading your Government to issue a Botanical Guide on the plan of Spicer's but a little fuller. One often feels that a word or two more would save much uncertainty at crucial points. The size of the flower — the prevailing colour and so on". Sir Henry and I have worked on many occasions in Tasmania with Mr Spicers admirable little book<note xml:id="ftn2" type="footnote" n="2">

               </note> and I can hardly describe to anyone but a botanical student — such as I am, the impulse which Spicer's book gave me. I went into the bush picked up a plant and in a minute or two I could find out all that was known about it. When my address as President of the Field Naturalists Club was delivered, the Argus sent me a slip to correct the verbatim report. I had some corrections to make and I saw the Day Editor. I had my Spicer with me and to my delight I saw a pot containing a flowering fuchsia on the mantelpiece in his room. I got him take the plant and made him, who was almost wholly ignorant of Botany, run it down to the Natural Order to which it belonged and he like many others who have used such a book was absolutely startled at his own efforts. Now, the money is voted for this year, so no question arises about a debate in the Assembly: all that is wanted is a permission from you to expend £170 of that vote on this work. Mr Service this morning told me to my astonishment that an educational work of this kind was no part of the duty of a government to publish. I have before me as I write a book published in 1877 "By authority" of the Government Printer and having the stamp of the "Education Department" called "Introduction to Botanical Teachings at the Schools of Victoria".<note xml:id="ftn3" type="footnote" n="3">

Once have a Key to unlock this work and it becomes available to everyone from the State school child to the Philosopher. I am writing no idle words, I am not speaking without experience — for I have seen &amp; used with my own little nieces in Tasmania Spicers book. Sir H. Lefroy accustomed to use the book gives his opinion of its worth in his words which I have quoted. If you desire I can promise to get up a deputation to you from the Royal Society &amp; the Field Naturalists Club jointly but in a matter of such plain common sense I feel I am not <space unit="chars" quantity="1"/>addressing you in vain</p>
