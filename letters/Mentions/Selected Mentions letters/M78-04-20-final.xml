The Land Regulations provide that the Government will not be responsible for any loss or inconvenience which the purchaser may experience nor will the purchase money be returned when any mistake with regard to boundaries is made, but it is not even […atated] in them that any person should throw up a selection once made. With regard to a remark made by Mr. Forrest in his note of the 4th that for his services Mr. Giles should have special consideration, it does not apply, because Mr. Giles has sold his right. Because Baron Von Mueller finds out that if he can get the right to select again he can sell that right now to a local capitalist probably at a profit, it is no reason to have weight with me and will form a most awkward precedent</p>
