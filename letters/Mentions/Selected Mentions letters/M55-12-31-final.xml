Gregory, 13 May and 26 May 1855. He may well at this point have advised Wilhelmi to apply for the position. Shortly afterwards, however, it became clear that M could join the expedition while retaining his rights in Victoria, and he agreed to go; see M to A. Gregory, 4 June 1855. In the same letter he suggested to Gregory that he might take an assistant with him, almost certainly having Wilhelmi in mind for this position, but Gregory made it plain that this would not be possible; see A. Gregory to M, 12 June 1855 (in this edition as 55-06-12a).</seg>
