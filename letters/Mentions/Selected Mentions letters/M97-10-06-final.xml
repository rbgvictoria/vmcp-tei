Meanwhile some of M's scientific friends had formed a separate Memorial Committee 'to secure sufficient funds to allow of the establishment of some permanent Memorial which shall worthily perpetuate his name' that was formally established as a national committee in November 1897; see W. Wiesbaden and W. Baldwin Spencer to the general public, November 1897 (in this edition as M97-11-00).</p>

He was now recorded (Victorian <seg style="font-style: italic; ">Hansard</seg>, 23 December 1896, p. 4953) as asking the Premier 'if the Government would be prepared to do anything in connexion with perpetuating the memory of the late Baron von Mueller?'. 'He did not generally stand up', he went on, 'for the purpose of advocating the erection of a monument to any man, but the late Baron von Mueller was worthy of some recognition. There was a desire on the part of many honorable members that something should be done to perpetuate his memory. The Premier had already promised to consider the matter, and he was sure the honorable gentleman would give it a fair and reasonable consideration. He would like to know whether anything had yet been done to perpetuate the memory of the late baron, who was one of the most learned men this country had ever known and certainly a man from whom the country had received more benefit that from any other citizen'. To this, the Premier, G. Turner, responded: 'I have had no opportunity of considering the matter. I have promised to look into it.'</p>
