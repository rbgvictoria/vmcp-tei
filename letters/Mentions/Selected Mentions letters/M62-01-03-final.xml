Mus. of Melb. this specimen wh. wld. be of much greater interest in this country from local associations than it would be in the Museums or collections of any other country. Specimens of this kind generally of smaller size are very common in the Museums of Europe and America, but the two Cranbourne ones are the only examples as yet made known in this Country and the smaller of these two has already fallen into the hands of a person<note xml:id="ftn3" type="footnote" n="3">

Under these circumstances Mr Bruce would be doing a great service to Science in Victoria if he would consent to present the Meteorite to the Public Museum, the Government (Museum Department) paying all the expenses of excavation and transport if Mr Bruce will have the goodness to permit the work to be done. On hearing from Mr Bruce the Museum assistant (Mr Straubel) will be sent down to make the necessary inspection preliminary to calling for a tender for the extraction and transport of the mass.</p>
