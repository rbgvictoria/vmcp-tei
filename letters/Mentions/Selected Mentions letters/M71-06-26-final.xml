Had this plant stood two or three years thriving so that it is beyond all doubt that internal live is not wanting, it is of great value, but the meantime all is risk. In your description you must quite openly state that the plant has been in my possession having been imported direct from Australia, — clear breast is always the best thing of all.

Finally, my dear sir, I need not mention that in case you want me to return the specimen I hope you will not hesitate in telling me so, without any guarantee of course on my part of course of its safe arrival, — the weight is enormous and I had about 27 men to bring the plant from the packing shed, where it was unpacked, to the place where it stands now. I had a wall broken down and built up again for the [fern] to recover, — I had a special place of accommodation and so I did not mind to break the end of a house. Let Mr Müller send more such wonders in the vegetable world, — big and enormous things. No Stove plants but all cold!
