This Colony has never helped him in any way and altho thousands of letters have been written by him all in the cause of science, his only reward had been the collection of a few specimens of plants. — I should be glad if you could on this occasion act in such a way towards him as will let him feel, that this Colony is grateful for all the services he has rendered to it</p>
