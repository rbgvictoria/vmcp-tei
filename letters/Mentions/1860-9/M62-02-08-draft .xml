               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>I must explain however with regard to the course I have taken in the matter, that when Dr Mueller called on me the other day with a letter which he had received for Professor Maskelyne asking for his aid to secure the Meteorite for the British Museum, that I had not the smallest idea that it was contemplated to retain it in the colony; and though I promised therefore as he desired to speak to my advisers about it before it was finally sent away, I suggested that he shld not wait for that, lest Mr Abel or somebody else shd get possession of it, and offered to guarantee the expense of getting it home out of my own pocket.</p>

But my enquiries were last September brought to a conclusion by learning from Mr FitzGibbon that Mr Abel would only sell the small one on very high terms, and that Mr Bruce<note xml:id="ftn3" type="footnote" n="3">
