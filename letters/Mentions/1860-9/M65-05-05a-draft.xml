               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>In Geelong Ballarat Sandhurst &amp; Bendigo, Clunes, Creswick, Talbot Warrnambool and Belfast besides various pastoral districts, committees or private individuals are engaged in our behalf. In Adelaide under the patronage of Lady Daly our friends are proceeding with the work. In New Zealand also we have the promise of assistance but it is evident that a considerable time must elapse before the result of efforts now being made so widely can be ascertained. The prospect of a liberal grant from your Government would be a great encouragement to us in our arduous undertaking, we would therefore express the fervent hope that you will not hesitate to accede to our request and to take under your fostering care an enterprize which if efficiently carried out would redound to the honor both of your administration and of the colony in which you hold so high a position. I beg to enclose the copy of a letter from M M'Intyre whose valuable services unless we can secure them at an early period will be lost to our cause.</p>
