I was authorized to put myself in communication with the respective Colonies &amp; enquire how far they were disposed to unite &amp; contriubte the needful expenses.

I now therefore take the great liberty of addressing you; &amp; should you be favorable to the plan, you will perhaps think it right to recommend it to the legislature; in that case you will perhaps dome the honour to write to me.</p>
