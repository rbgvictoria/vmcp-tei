               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>In Botanical Science I have not much to report except good progress in a work which my Father has been incessantly urging on the Government for many years — the publication of cheap good Colonial Floras by the Governments. That of Hong Kong is done by Mr Bentham by the Colonial Office for 16/. — The Cape of Good Hope is being done by the Cape Govt. &amp; Dr Harvey &amp; Sonder are authors — one volume is out, &amp; it will take 6 or 7 to complete it. The Australian Governments have just voted money for a Flora of all Australia at the rate of about £300 pr volume, of which there will be 6 or 7 &amp; Mr Bentham will undertake this. Poor Mueller had set his heart upon doing this &amp; could he have come to England we should have been glad that he had, &amp; we urged him to do so, but in the Colony without the plants of Cook, Banks, Brown, Cunningham, Frazer, Bidwill, Mitchell, Drummond, Preiss &amp;c the work was obviously impossible &amp; would all have had to be done over again — so Mueller gave it up very generously &amp; handsomely &amp; has thus got more real renown than if he had insisted upon doing the task imperfectly in the colony — Bentham will associate his name on the title page, so that little difficulty is overcome. The Ceylon Govt has just now announced its intention of begining its Colonial Flora &amp; giving Mr Thwaites the authorship.</p>
