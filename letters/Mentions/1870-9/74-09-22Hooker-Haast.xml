I quite agree with you that he was very ill advised to have refused the Professorship — he might have worked it as he pleased — it would have given him status. I pleased his friends — as to the Garden it was bad in one way under him, &amp; it will be bad in others ow. The whole thing was far beyond the demand of the Colony in a scientific point of view &amp; behind it is an instructional &amp; horticultural one.</p>
