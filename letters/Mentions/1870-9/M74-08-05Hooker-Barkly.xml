There is no indication in the volume as to the date or author of the transcriptions, or the location of the originals, (presumably if they exist they are with Barkly's archive, if that exists) and the Archivist at Kew in June 2000 has no knowledge of the provenance of the volume. Folios 152-260 are to Sir Henry Barkly, October 1865 to November 1876, with one of 18 August 1866 (possibly an enclosure) to Charles Meller (see below) and 261-3 to Lady Annie M. Barkly, July-Aug 1867. Each letter in the Barkly series has been numbered</p>

I am sure that I could not get on here without such a man, and this the Govt. would have been only too glad to have given him for their own sake, as well as the Garden. George Mackay, who has seen him, tells me that he is very comfortably off and admirably placed for all Botanical purposes — he might have had the Botanical lectureship at the University as well, and this would have added to his income and position, but he rejected the offer with scorn I am told. It is just the same with his views on all branches of Botany, he cannot look with others' eyes<note xml:id="ftn2" type="footnote" n="2">
