                     xml:lang="en">This volume consists mainly of transcriptions, most in the form of typescript carbon copies, of Hooker's letters. There is no indication in the volume as to the date or author of the transcriptions, or the location of the originals, and the Archivist at Kew in June 2000 had no knowledge of the provenance of the volume. Folios 152-260 are to Sir Henry Barkly, October 1865 to November 1876, with one of 18 August 1866 (possibly an enclosure) to Charles Meller (see below) and ff. 261-3 to Lady Annie M. Barkly, July-Aug 1867. There are some gaps in the text and a few possible misreadings. Many letters have been annotated or asterisked in red ink or in pencil. Each letter in the Barkly series has been numbered. The subjects of the early letters are Hooker's various difficulties with the Board of Works 'under a department of Govt. already tired of scientific expenditure on Kew' (19 January 1866; f. 154), and Meller's journey to and health, conduct, and position at Mauritius, where Barkly was Governor, which apparently gave cause for concern.</p>

               </seg>Last night I heard from Mueller, that they had taken the Garden from him - I am deeply sorry for him, though I am sure it is for the best; he loaded himself with duties scarcely germane to his post, and which no human head could effectively administer on the scale he attempted. He is after all uncommonly well off, with his full salary, and collections and Library, a Museum Keeper, Clerk, and house rent, and all day long for Science! I am sure I would jump at such a post here, for the Garden is a very onerous duty, in its Public aspect most especially. Lord Canterbury spent the other evening here, and told me of the moral certainty of Mueller losing the Garden. I only hope that they will appoint a Gardener with some love of plants for their own sakes to it.</p>
