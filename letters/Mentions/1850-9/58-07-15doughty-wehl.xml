Has Edward the Steam ingine at the Mount now, &amp; how much horsepower? Do you see Mrs. Don sometimes? how nice to have so many ladys in the district now. - Port Valentine is since a week here, it is very pleasant for us, he has so much to tell &amp; is so jolly, he quite amyses me. Every body has a cold &amp; we are not excepted, I have sent to Dr. Greier for Medicin, feel very unwell again. It is my constant prayer that God may spare me for the sake of my little one, the thought that I might have to leave him is very sadning; who would care with so much love for the little darling as the Mother? Though I cannot say I am much better, I feel more cheerful, it must be because I trust to our heavenly father to give us what is best, that I feel more content. We should not put the thought of death from us, on the contrary think often about it &amp; it will loose its bitterness, have we not all to go sooner or later? Georgie suffers much from his teeth yet. He talks much of Berthi, he finds one in every picture. When his dinnertime comes he says "hungry" — &amp; calls "Port".</p>
