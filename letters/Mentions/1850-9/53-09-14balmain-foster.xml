But no authority has been issued, although some verbal communications were I think made'. Balmain was asked to: 'explain how price has been raised. it has occurred in several instances lately in his department'. Balmain replied on 5 October: 'The Greenhouses were tendered by Mr Duerdin to the Government at the price paid by him with his expenses thereon; he produced accounts to the amount of £664 before the purchase was approved stating that there was a small account for [...] which he had still to pay and which he would send in; this has been sent to me and amounts to £42.11: making in all £706:11:. The additional amount asked for was to cover the expense for carting, sorting and putting the buildings in such a state that they could be left without risk of injury until funds were voted for their erection.'</p>
