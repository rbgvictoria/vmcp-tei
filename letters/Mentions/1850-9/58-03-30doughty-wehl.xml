Friday my dearest husband came with a one horse dreh &amp; took us home the same day, we enjoyed the drive, that will show you we are all better. Georgie as well as can be expected &amp; will soon have a fifth tooth through, he is a bit cross &amp; pinches my cheek when he can get to it, but when I look at him hard he takes my head between his little hands &amp; kisses me, the little monkey! He can say Dadie; when I open the Noah's ark he begins to meau, grunt &amp; crow, holding up the respective animals to show me. We are now, God be thanked, so happy, the visit has done us so much good, we nearly lived outdoors. And what a pleasure to come home, every thing painted, doors white, &amp; every thing so beautifully clean, quite a pleasure to put up the white curtains &amp; fill the vases. The weather is so lovely now; - what a nice change it would have been to send me your little Bertha with Mrs. Crouch, we are going to Portland in a week &amp; could have met her there, I would like to have her with me for a time. George thinks of getting a new Dog cart, fancy they ask for an American Buggie £ 70 to 80. So much we cannot afford. While I was away the Bishop &amp; Mrs. Perry from Melbourne were here for a night. George was at home, I would have liked to make their acquaintance, they know Ferdinand. From my Sister in law Mrs. Taylor I had a long kind letter, she wishes me to write at once which I intend to do. Charles Valentine also wrote to me "My dear Aunt" we had a good laugh over it. Portus is coming to see us soon, perhaps Ferdinand also. The Rostock University has conferd the title of Mr. of medicin to him. Give my kind regard to William Wehl, hope to make his acquaintance soon, &amp; to Mr. Höltge.</p>
