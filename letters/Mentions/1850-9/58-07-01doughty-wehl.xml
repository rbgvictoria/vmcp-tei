               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>To morrow I expect a letter from you with good news &amp; that Edward returned home safely from Adelaide &amp; with all news from there. — My George is not at all well, he is just gone to bed, he complains of rheumatism. I think he overworks himself, he is always so knocked up at night. He has to go out in all weathers. We think sometimes it might be better to sell St. Helens as the climat does not seem to suit me; we have both aged much this last year. Sunday week was a beautiful day, we drove to Yambuck &amp; heard Mr. Clarke preach &amp; stayed the night with Suters, &amp; after paying Bicknells a visit, drove home. I enjoyed the trip. Georgie had been left with Elisabeth. Last night had severe frost, to my sorrow, a number of plants were killed, I had only planted a newly made round flowerbed. Ferdinand did not come, as I expected. — Dear darling Georgie can walk now, he pushes the chairs about with great speed. I give him porridge for breakfast, he calls it poddi. Sago is Hogo &amp; Bertha "Barti", I showed him a picture a boy &amp; girl &amp; when he sees it he says: ah Barbi &amp; Dadi, that is Georgie. When he wakes up in the morning he calls Papa, then we take him in &amp; he kisses us &amp; pats us on the cheeks saying: poor! is it not laughable?</p>
