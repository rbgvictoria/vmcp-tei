George comes to dine at 3 o'clock &amp; is out there till 8 pm. — So many people pass here, it is quite a nuisance. Yesterday no less than 16 came &amp; expected to be fed, 6 slept &amp; fed in the hut. — on Xmas day George killed a 5 feet long snake in our dressing room, that was the third killed in there, we have to be always on the lookout. — Only think, Dodds did not come, after I had the rooms ready for them. — Our dear little son is well, he stretches his little hand already for the stockwhip &amp; is so happy when he sees his Papa on horseback &amp; watches him as far as he can see him. I never put him to bed till he is sleepy, when I ask him then: shall Mama put Georgie to bed, he jumps with pleasure, when I have put him down. I go away, he crows a little while &amp; then goes to sleep. He is getting a little curly head. Now I must say good night. God bless us all!</p>
