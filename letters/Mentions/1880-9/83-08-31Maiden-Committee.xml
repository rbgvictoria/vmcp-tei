               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>Baron von Mueller was good enough to show me the collections of woods, fibres, seeds, &amp;c prepared by him for display at the Calcutta Exhibition. The collection of woods is especially noteworthy. Each sample of timber is bound into the shape of an ordinary closed book. The backs are polished while the "leaves" (solid in the […]) are in their natural state. As in an ordinary book […] which here bears the name of the wood used the locality whence it was obtained I beg to submit a specimen book. The great utility of the arrangement […] […] The Baron also showed me a collection of articles (e.g. pipes, paper knives, […] […] — handles, [naves], &amp;c, &amp;c) illustrating the adaptability of various Australian woods for special purposes.</p>

I beg to recommend that a sum not exceeding £30 may be placed at the disposal of Baron von Mueller for this purpose. For this sum a very fair collection (chiefly of Victorian timbers), can be obtained. There are two reasons which lead me to make this recommendation. The maker of the specimens is now becoming quite expert in the business, and Baron Mueller has a collection of woods the identity of which is beyond dispute.</p>

I propose, at the close of the forthcoming summer to take active steps to complete the collection of New South Wales woods now in the Museum, and to commence at an early date the preparation of articles similar to those prepared by Baron Mueller from Victorian woods.</p>

This is a matter that I propose to bring under your notice soon after the opening of the Museum.<note xml:id="ftn2" type="footnote" n="2">
