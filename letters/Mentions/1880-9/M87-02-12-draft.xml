               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>herewith I have the honor to forward a detailed statement of expenses incurred through taking Lieutenant Dittrich as Botanical collector &amp;c on my recent journey across Australia, also a copy of an account against me which was sent by Lieut Dittrich, enclosed in a most insulting letter, two hours after he sailed for Melbourne and fourteen (14) days after I had furnished him, with a statement; the whole of this time he was in Adelaide and made no claim. I merely acknowledged receipt of this letter. A few days ago I received another insulting letter from him threatening legal proceedings unless his claim for £18.0.1 be settled by a certain date (3rd Febr.) of this letter I have taken no notice whatever, being quite satisfied that he has no just claim on me.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>Mr Dittrich's offer was to accompany me for his expenses and outfit.

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>You will remember that I stated, when asking the Government or the Geographical Society for assistance to enable me to take a botanical collector, that Baron Von Mueller had promised me £20.</p>

               style="font-family: Geneva; font-size: 12pt; "
               xml:lang="en">
               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>After numerous letters passing between the Baron and myself re payment of that sum, he wrote me last week that he had been induced to pay the balance of the £20 (he having some time previously paid £10 to Mr D.) to Mr Dittrich because, to use his own words "Lieutenant Dittrich was here in so great a difficulty after his return as to induce me to pay him also the second instalment of the £20 which I originally promised for the botanic collector as a contribution of mine. He having had no salary could not be left quite helpless here and I feel sure no one will grudge him this small sum after so long a journey. One of the reasons also why I paid the full sum to him was this that for several months he enjoyed the hospitality of the squatters away from the party so that he had then no need to draw on the Expedition stores." To this letter from Baron Von Mueller I replied pointing out — that I thought, the proper way of looking at this question was - Did he - the Baron — promise to pay me £20 as an inducement for me to make a collection of botanical specimens? If so — he should have paid it — If he did not promise it to me - then whether he paid Lieut Dittrich any sum, large or small, had nothing whatever to do with me, and intimating surprise that he could have hesitated what to do in this matter.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>In regard to the items in Mr Dittrich's account against me — Fare by steamer has been allowed — His claim for £1 for cab to go to Williamstown could not be entertained as he should have gone by train at a cost of 1/- "Telegrams &amp; Cab hire 8/- - " Cabhire 10/- was allowed. As regards clothing. When he arrived I showed him the list of clothing I had purchased for myself, and said I would get the same for him. He replied "I do not want singlets sox or handkerchiefs and I have one towel and would rather take this Helmet — I have had it in different countries for the past 3 or 4 years-" I therefore did not purchase those things although I offered to do so if he chose to leave those he had brought with him. The price I paid for my singlets was 12/9. Helmet hat 7/9 sox 8/6 - I supplied him with two towels — I only took 3 myself. The boots he must have carried in his swag because those I supplied him he wore from Hergott to Port Darwin. Bush knife he brought with him — Under any circumstances <seg style="">

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>I regret very much that the photographs were all failures. I cannot account for it as Mr Dittrich had all material and assistance he required. This much I may say that he obstinately refused to accept any suggestions I might make about photographing. For instance, at Dalhousie, where we were most kindly treated, I asked him to photograph the station with the Messrs Smith &amp; Bagot on the verhandah, as they had expressed a desire to have one. At first he said he would not - but afterwards did, without advising any one of his intention consequently the place was shut up and two members of my party were on the verandah attending to some of the camp equipment. At Powell's Creek telegraph station I also asked him to take a photograph of the Station — He did so when the house was closed and the station master away. From such a distance was the photograph taken that had the picture been a clear one, the houses would have shown but as mere white specks</p>

In fact he kept every thing he could lay his hands on. — The compass was lost and the revolver Mr D refused to return to me.
