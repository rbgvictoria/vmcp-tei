               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>Two years ago I forwarded a log of this species, and at that time Baron von Muller gave it as his opinion that the species may be new, in which case he would name it after you, but that to decide the question and to determine the species he would require flowering specimens. My friend Mr Allan, Storekeeper has by my request watched the trees for flowering and obtained a few flowers about 18 months ago; those I sent to Baron von Muller last January but have heard nothing more of the matter. Mr Allan asserts that the species does not flower every year, and even when it does, it flowers but scantily. […] Lately when at "Mountain Top" I had a tree cut down which is there called "Silvertop" — one of <seg style="">
                  <hi rend="underline">three</hi>
               </seg> different species called so —, and I found that the <seg style="">
                  <hi rend="underline">umbels</hi>
               </seg> of this species have a regular cover, much the same in shape as that of the individual flower buds, but dark brown or almost black in colour. This cover lifts of in the same manner as the cover of the bud, and then the buds composing the umbel separate. I forwarded specimens of the tree with those umbel covers to Baron von Muller and especially pointed out the matter of the umbel covers, of which it seems he has taken no notice, but simply says that the tree is a variety of Euc. goniocalyx. By the specimens I forward to you now you will see that it can hardly be believed that such is the case. […]</p>
