                     <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>The matter of a memorial was raised in the Legislative Assembly on 12 November 1896:</p>
                  <p rend="Footnote"
                     style="font-family: Geneva; margin-left: 0.3335in; margin-right: 0in; text-indent: -0.3335in; font-size: 9pt; "

                     <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>
                     <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>[…] Prendergast argued that 'the erection of a national memorial of the late Baron von Mueller' was warranted on the basis that '<seg style="font-style: italic; ">Flora australiensis</seg> dealt with almost the whole of the plant-life of the Australian colonies' and suggested that the Premier, George Turner, contact the Premiers of the other colonies of Australia to enlist their support. Turner said he would 'look into the matter'. Alfred Deakin supported the suggestion and praised M's work, but he argued that as M had lived and worked in Victoria it was the responsibility of that Government to honour his work. However, since 'there was no man who was more truly Australian', contributions from other parts of Australia would be welcomed. J. McIntyre also supported the suggestion and added his praise of M.</p>

                     <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>Mr Rogers said that he could tell the Assembly how M had wished to be commemorated because M 'had told him in conversation on two occasions fully and exactly what he would like to have done in order that his name might go down to posterity in this colony. It would not involve expense — or at least so trifling an amount that it need not be considered. It was simply this: — That the whole of the magnificent collection of specimens which he had gathered from every portion of Australasia, indeed from the whole of the civilized world, and which was to a large extent a gift by him to the people of Victoria, as he spent fully half his salary in purchasing and procuring them himself, should be segregated from any other collection already made, or to be made in future, and placed in some suitable position in the Technological Museum or the Musuem in the University grounds, if the building accommodation would allow, or in some other place, and designated the Von Mueller collection. … [Rogers] 'believed that he was the only member of the Assembly who followed [M] to his grave. He had a most profound respect for Baron von Mueller, who, despite his oddities and peculiarities, was a true and thorough scientist — one who was honoured by the Government of his native country and the English Government, and by every one in this community. … the Government and the people of Victoria … would show an utter want of appreciation of what was right and proper in this matter if they did not comply with the late baron's request. That wonderful collection of 1,000,000 specimens would be a grand monument to the industry, genius, talents, and perserverance of Baron von Mueller …' (<seg style="font-weight: bold; ">cite</seg>).</p>
