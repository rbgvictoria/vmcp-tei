               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>With reference to the work of preparing a supplementary volume to Bentham's Flora of Australia. I hope that you will believe me when I state that I sought not the honor of doing this work; for a long time I have been asked by numbers of botanical workers to prepare such a volume, it being the opinion of the many especially in N. S. Wales &amp; Queensland that Baron Mueller with all his advantages would never be content to follow in the lines of Bentham. We cannot look at his works without seeing how directly opposed he is to the system and style adopted by Bentham, Hooker, and in fact nearly every other botanist of note. I must say that such a volume as would be prepared by Baron Mueller is not what is required.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>[...] the completion of such a volume you will see does not require a very large amount of botanic learning which it does require in my opinion that the compiler should have a long experience of Australian plant [...] and considering that I have had fifty four years experience of Australia I am perhaps as well fitted for the work as Baron Mueller, whom allow me to tell you I have known from his arrival in Australia, I have sent the Baron one of the circulars but so far he has not acknowledged it. I hope that we shall all be friendly over the matter. I have no unfriendly feeling towards Baron Mueller although I feel quite certain that he would never follow the system of the Flora, and I do. Very few of my plants appear in the Census of Australian Plants although plants are admitted of which little or no description has been published</p>
