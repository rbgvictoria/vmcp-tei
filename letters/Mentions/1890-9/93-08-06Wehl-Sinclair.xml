               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>I have to apologize for keeping you waiting so long for an answer to your welcome letter and have to thank you for your sympathy. Yes, I had a close shave from very serious injury, but still it was painfull enough and most tiresome and inconvenient to have to stay in bed for a fortnight. Mr &amp; Mrs Frost, with whom I am staying, were most kind to me &amp; Mrs F nursed me with all the care &amp; attention of a mother. I can get about again now as usual only feeling a little stiffness after much walking, when I require the assistance of a stick. I have been kept very busy lately making up for lost time having got considerably behind with my office work &amp; as I have about 400 miles of travelling to do every week I can only do my writing in the intervals I have here and then I often feel inclined to do only what is absolutely necessary. My next weeks, or rather this weeks, travelling will be — Broken Hill to Tarrawinger &amp; back, 80 miles, tomorrow; leave here Tuesday morning for Pack Saddle Station &amp; get back here Thursday evening, distance 240 miles; Saturday Broken Hill to Jarrawinga &amp; back 80 miles total 400 miles. You will wonder what all this travelling is for; well I am Chief Agent in this Western District for the great firm of Cobb &amp; Co Limited Coach Proprietors &amp; Mail Contractors. All the Agent s at other places this side of the Darling River have to send their takings to me and I fix up with the Head Office at Bathurst. I am going to Pack Saddle Station, which is about half way up our line to Tibooburra near the Queensland Border, to see that things are going on alright along the road Cobb &amp; Co is the best firm I have ever worked for, they never give me any unnecessary trouble and allow me to use my own discretion and do whatever I think right in connection with my branch of the business.</p>

               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>I had a long letter from the Baron tow or three days ago in which he asked me to explain to all my brothers &amp; sisters (big contract this) that his not writing oftener was not due to a want of <seg style="">

               </seg> but that he had too much to do; he says he has written 2480 letters from January to June 1893 not including over 100 private letters. He ought to have you as private secretary as you understand the art of letter writing as well as anyone I know, but I expect the Latin would pull you up.</p>
