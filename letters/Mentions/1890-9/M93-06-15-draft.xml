               <space dim="horizontal" extent="tab"/>The agreeing to prepare a supplementary volume to Benthams Flora Australiensis has [...] such a storm about me that I must write to let you know how matters stand with reference to that work. I sent Baron Mueller one of the circulars and it would seem that instead of communicating his views upon the subject to me direct wrote to others complaining of me having done him an injury or something of the kind, this brought me a letter from one of his friends in South Australia. Being a member of the Roy. Soc. of South Australia I naturally sent the Society a copy of the circular, when it was received by them instead of stating to me direct their objections to me preparing the work, they sent a letter to the head of the government here asking if I had been authorized by the Queensland Government work. I was then called upon for an explanation (only [...]) I did not have the letter sent to me so of course sent no [...] reply. This I considered a most discourteous piece of behaviour on the part of the Society and I have written them to — for you will easily understand that such a letter to the head of ones government stands as a sorry complaint[.] In my case it can do no harm but were I not so well known it might have a contrary effect[.] Mr Tryon was reproved by the Minister of his Department for publishing his letter reflecting upon my ability in the papers, but since that he has in the same style from what I can make out to my friends. So you see that what with one and another I have been made very miserable. So I have agreed to leave the work in his hands if he will follow closely in the lines of the former volumes of the work using the same system and nomenclature also inserting as well as of all the plants which have become naturalized. I have also drawn his attention to the fact that he has studiously avoided noticing in his publications the greater number of plants named and described by me — this he denies of course but however agrees to the former — Thus I leave the subject and I must say with regret but I have a great deal of work always on hand and cannot stand to be constantly worried. I shall as time allows go on with the work so that if anything happens I shall be able to make use of what I have already prepared — I hope the above will fully explain how matters stand and you may tell others.</p>
