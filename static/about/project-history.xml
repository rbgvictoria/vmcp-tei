            <p rend="Firstparagraph" style="hyphenate: false; " xml:lang="en">This work has its origins in the 1970s, when three of the editors independently began researching different aspects of Ferdinand von Mueller’s life and work. Doris M. Sinkora (1927–2017), Royal Botanic Gardens<space unit="chars" quantity="1"/>Victoria, was involved in locating surviving batches of Mueller’s correspondence to aid in the interpretation of his specimens at the National Herbarium of Victoria. She also contributed to the production of a comprehensive list of Mueller’s publications1.<space unit="chars" quantity="1"/>Johannes H. Voigt (1929–2020), Stuttgart University, began researching German-Australian relations during a fellowship at the Australian National University, 1968–71. Mueller quickly emerged as a key figure in this context2. Arthur M. Lucas, then at Flinders University in Adelaide, identified Mueller as a suitable case study in a larger project on science education.</p>
            <p rend="Textbody"
               style="margin-top: 0.0597in; margin-bottom: 0.0597in; hyphenate: false; "
               xml:lang="en">In 1987, Voigt and Lucas (who had by now met Sinkora) independently contacted Rod W. Home in his capacity as Professor of History and Philosophy of Science at the University of Melbourne about their shared interest in Mueller3. Home suggested the four scholars join forces to see if there were any prospect of obtaining funds for an edition of Mueller’s correspondence.</p>
            <p rend="Textbody"
               style="margin-top: 0.0597in; margin-bottom: 0.0597in; hyphenate: false; "
               xml:lang="en">As lead applicant, Home obtained three years of funding from the Australian Research Council (ARC) in 1988, and the in-principle interest of a Melbourne publisher in issuing the correspondence in book form. The editors appointed historian Sara Maroske as a researcher to find and transcribe Mueller’s correspondence. An advisory Board was also appointed to advise on issues arising in the production and editing of the correspondence.</p>
            <p rend="Textbody"
               style="margin-top: 0.0597in; margin-bottom: 0.0597in; hyphenate: false; "
               xml:lang="en">A template for the transcription and translation of Mueller’s letters and a house style for editing and documentation were developed4. Members of the project team shared responsibility for locating Mueller correspondence in different parts of the world, an effort that soon revealed many more letters had survived than expected.</p>
            <p rend="Textbody"
               style="margin-top: 0.0597in; margin-bottom: 0.0597in; hyphenate: false; "
               xml:lang="en">In 1998, historian Monika Wells<space unit="chars" quantity="1"/>replaced Maroske, who commenced a doctorate at the University of Melbourne on Mueller5. Maroske remained on the project team as an editor, and Wells was also recognised as an editor in 2006. The fifth, and final editor, Thomas A. Darragh, of Museums Victoria, initially joined the project as a member of the advisory board. He gradually took over responsibility for the German language translations from Doris Sinkora. In preparation for the publication of this electronic edition he was formally designated an editor in 2019.</p>
            <p rend="Textbody"
               style="margin-top: 0.0597in; margin-bottom: 0.0597in; hyphenate: false; "
               xml:lang="en">The ARC supported the project for five years. Thereafter a number of bodies funded the researcher position up to 2004 including the R.E. Ross Trust, Sidney Myer Trust, William Buckland Foundation, Victorian Department of Natural Resources and Environment, Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft and King’s College London. The editors have subsequently continued working on the correspondence as circumstances allowed, and it became the major focus of Home, Lucas and Darragh after their respective ‘retirements’.</p>

               xml:lang="en">The project’s initial prospective publisher withdrew support when the magnitude of Mueller’s surviving correspondence became clear. Nevertheless, with the assistance of a subsidy organised by Günter Klatt of the Einhorn-Rats-Apotheke in Husum, Peter Lang (Bern) agreed to publish a selection of Mueller’s correspondence in three volumes, along with a CD-ROM of the entire correspondence. The three volumes appeared under the title of<space unit="chars" quantity="1"/>

               style="margin-top: 0.0597in; margin-bottom: 0.0597in; hyphenate: false; "
               xml:lang="en">As the internet developed<space unit="chars" quantity="1"/>it became clear that CD-ROM was not as suitable as online publication, which offered a flexible, secure and widely accessible platform for the correspondence. In 2017, preparation for on-line publication began with the co-operation of Gavan McCarthy, the Director of the University of Melbourne eScholarship Research Centre. In 2020, Royal Botanic Gardens Victoria agreed to be the main electronic publisher6.</p>
