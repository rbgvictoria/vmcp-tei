            <p rend="First%20paragraph" style="" xml:lang="en">Some of the correspondence held in the corpus of letters at Royal Botanic Gardens Victoria includes references to Indigenous Cultural Knowledge, such as the medicinal use of certain plants by Traditional Owners. In order to minimise the risk of exploitation of such knowledge, an exhaustive review of the letters was carried out to identify and exclude such letters from online publication. Approximately 96 letters have been excluded for this reason.</p>
